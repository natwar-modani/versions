asimov died on april 6, 1992 after getting infected with hiv from tainted blood transfused during a 1983 surgical procedure. the fact that aids was the cause of his  death was only revealed ten years later in janet asimov's biography it's been a good life.

science fiction
asimov began contributing stories to science fiction magazines in 1939; his most famous single story is arguably "nightfall" (1941). in 1942 he began his foundation stories -- later collected in the foundation trilogy: foundation (1951), foundation and empire (1952), and second foundation (1953) -- which recount the collapse and rebirth of a vast interstellar empire in the universe of the future and may be his most famous work of science fiction.  he continued the series with foundation's edge (1982) and foundation and earth (1986) and then went back to before the original trilogy with prelude to foundation (1988) and forward the foundation (1992).

his robot stories -- many of which were collected in his collection, i, robot (1950) -- were begun at about the same time and promulgated a set of rules of ethics for robots (see three laws of robotics) and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers' treatment of the subject.
