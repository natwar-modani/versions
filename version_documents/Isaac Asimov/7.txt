asimov's family emigrated to the  united states when he was  three years old. he grew up in brooklyn, n.y., graduating from columbia university in 1939 and taking a ph.d. there in 1948. he then joined the faculty of boston university, with which he remained associated thereafter.

asimov began contributing stories to science fiction magazines in 1939 and in 1950 published his first book, /pebble in the sky. his trilogy of novels, foundation, foundation and empire, and second foundation (1951-53), which recounts the collapse and rebirth of a vast interstellar empire in the universe of the future, is his most famous work of science fiction. 

in the short-story collection i, robot (1950), he developed a set of ethics for robots (see three laws of robotics) and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers' treatment of the subject.

among asimov's books on various topics in science, written with lucidity and humour, are /the chemicals of life (1954), /inside the atom (1956), /the world of nitrogen (1958), /life and energy (1962), /the human brain (1964), /the neutrino (1966), /science, numbers and i (1968), /our world in space (1974), and /views of the universe (1981). he also published two volumes of autobiography.
