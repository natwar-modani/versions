 opening heading 
this is interesting, but it ignores the long history of the term 'hierarchy' in favor of contemporary business.  'boss'?  not even a sense of context for that word? --michaeltinkle

"hierarchial organization, as a concept, is opposed by just one political ideology, namely anarchism." -- i don't believe this: anarchism is usually defined as opposition to the
concept of government, not hierarchical organisations in general. --
"libertarian socialists see themselves as dedicated to opposing all forms of authority, coercion and social hierarchy. in this they include not only coercion by the state, but also by businesses, schools, religous institutions and at times even the family as well."  - - from wikipedia on libertarian socialism, which is the oldest, most widespread, form of anarchism. you must be refering to anarcho-capitalism.

 comment: the reverse move was done in 2009 to avoid confusion with hierarchy. now it's causing confusion with organizational structure instead. a not to be confused with hatnote directing to hierarchy is a better alternative. --pnm (talk) 01:04, 3 june 2010 (utc)
 comment: found the discussion from that move: talk:hierarchy#scattered_info_and_possible_merges --pnm (talk) 01:16, 3 june 2010 (utc)
