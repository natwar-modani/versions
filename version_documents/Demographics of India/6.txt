india has a population of approximately 1.1 billion people (2006), comprising approximately one-sixth of the world's population. this population is remarkably diverse; it has more than two thousand ethnic groups, and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (indo-european, dravidian, austro-asiatic and tibeto-burman languages) as well as two language isolates (nihali and the burushaski language spoken in disputed parts of jammu & kashmir). further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. these factors render the task of comprehensively detailing the demographics of india prohibitive; some important indices are available, nevertheless.

salient features
although india occupies only 2.4% of the world's land area, it supports over 16% of the world's population. currently it is the second most populous nation on earth, though if current trends persist, india will replace china as the most populous nation in less than 40 years. almost 40% of indians are younger than 15 years of age. more than 70% of the people live in more than 550,000 villages, and the remainder in more than 200 towns and cities. 

although 80.5% of the people are hindus, india is also home to the second-largest muslim population in the world (13.1%). india also contains the majority of the world's zoroastrians (0.01%), sikhs (1.93%) and  jains (0.40%). other religious groups include christians (2.3%), buddhists (0.77%), jews and bahá'ís.

census
the most recent census of india was performed in 2001. it was the 14th census in an unbroken series, and the 6th after independence in 1947 (except for assam which did not figure in the 1981 census). eight censuses were performed under the british raj, the first one was carried out throughout the 1860s and completed in 1871. after this, there has been one census every decade.

the 2001 census was conducted in two phases, the first being housenumbering and houselisting operations, carried out in may 2000, and the second being population enumeration, carried out from february 9 to 28, 2001. the reference time for the census is 1 march, 2001. the houseless population was enumerated on 28 february. a revisional round was undertaken 1 to 5 march 2001 to account for mutations between the time of visit in february and 1 march.

the total population calculated for 1 march 2001 was  1,027,015,247, making the 2001 census the first to count more than a billion indians. the population had risen by 21.34% compared to the 1991 total. the female population had increased by 0.3 percentage points to 48.4%.

religious breakdown

censuses were conducted in india in ancient times with examples such as kautilya's arthashastra which describes the collection of population statistics for taxation. the british census in 1871 was the first conducted in modern times in india.

the 2001 census figures released by the india census commission give a breakdown by various parameters including religion.

however, some unofficial estimates claim a higher figure of muslim population supposedly discounted in censuses. for instance, in an interview with a well circulated newspaper of india the hindu justice k.m. yusuf, a retired judge from calcutta high court and chairman of west bengal minority commission, says that the real percentage of muslims in india is at least 20%. . on the other hand, some believe that muslim population figures are exaggerated due to various reasons. for instance, as per syed shahabuddin, a diplomat-turned-politician, a muslim scholar and one of the members in the all india muslim personal law board, both hindu and muslim ‘spokesmen’, speaking for their respective communities amplify and exaggerate the muslim population in india, the first, to convince their followers about the rising ‘islamic menace’, a threat to the country and at least to its hindu character, the second, to raise the morale of a politically deprived, educationally backward, economically poor and socially vilified, frustrated community.

ethnic groups
main article: racial groups in india
unlike the usa, uk, and australian censuses, the national census of india does not recognize racial or ethnic groups within india kumar, jayant. census of india. 2001. september 4, 2006. <http://www.censusindia.net/>. but recognizes many of the tribal groups as scheduled castes and tribes (see list of scheduled tribes in india). organizations and individuals not affiliated with india's national census have classified india into racial/ethnic groups. these racial and ethnic groups are debated (see racial groups in india (historical definitions)). according to the joshua project, there are 2,334 ethnic groups in india.joshua project: people groups in india the indian people are descended from more or less all of the peoples that historically settled the subcontinent, including the caucasoid groups of dravidians, indo-aryans, iranians, bactrians, europeans, greeks, hepthalites, arabs, the australoid austro-asiatics, the mongoloid tibeto-burmans, kushans,  turks, mughals, and a few african siddis exist as well. 

it should be noted that dravidian, indo-aryan, austro-asiatic and tibeto-burman are linguistic terms and cannot be directly taken as ethnic terms. it simply means a speaker of a language belonging to a particular linguistic family. the speakers of these languages descend from a plethora of different ethnic groups that eventually adopted one or more set of languages. the imprint of each of these groups can be found in at least some small segments of the population, but at the same time over a long period of time these superficial differences in appearances have blurred to a great extent. the framework of the culture of the indian people comes from these various peoples who contributed to indian civilization as it is today.
