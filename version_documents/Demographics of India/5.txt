india houses a population of 1.1 billion people (2006), comprising approximately one-sixth of the world's population. this population is remarkably diverse; it has over a thousand ethnic groups, and every major religion is represented, as are several major families of languages, as well as numerous smaller language families and language isolates. further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. these factors render the task of comprehensively detailing the demographics of india prohibitive; some important indices are available, nevertheless.

salient features
although india occupies only 2.4% of the world's land area, it supports over 15% of the world's population. only china has a larger population, and that might change in fewer than a 100 years, if current trends persist. almost 40% of indians are younger than 15 years of age. more than 70% of the people live in more than 550,000 villages, and the remainder in more than 200 towns and cities.

over thousands of years of its history, india has had invasions and migrations from the middle east, central asia and the west, as well as migrations from tibet and southern china; indian people and culture have absorbed and changed these influences to produce a remarkable racial and cultural synthesis. religion, caste, and language are major determinants of social and political organization in india today. the government has recognized 22 languages as official; hindi is the most widely spoken. india also has the second largest number of english speakers in the world with over 150 million people speaking english in india.

although 77.7% of the people are hindus, india is also home to the second-largest muslim population in the world (16.2%). india also contains the majority of the world's zoroastrians (0.01%). other religious groups include christians (2.3%), sikhs (1.84%), buddhists (0.76%), jains (0.40%), jews and bahá'ís.

the caste system reflects indian occupational and socio-religiously defined hierarchies. traditionally, there are four broad categories of castes (varnas), including a category of outcastes, earlier called "untouchables" but now commonly referred to as "dalits." within these broad categories there are thousands of castes and subcastes, called jātis, whose relative status varies from region to region. despite economic modernization and laws countering discrimination against the lower end of the class structure, the caste system remains an important source of social identification for most hindus and many non-hindus as well, thus making it a potent factor in the political life of the country.

census
the most recent census of india was performed in 2001. it was the 14th census in an unbroken series, and the 6th after independence in 1947 (except for assam which did not figure in the 1981 census). eight censuses were performed under the british raj, the first one was carried out throughout the 1860s and completed in 1871. after this, there has been one census every decade.

the 2001 census was conducted in two phases, the first being housenumbering and houselisting operations, carried out in may 2000, and the second being population enumeration, carried out from february 9 to 28, 2001. the reference time for the census is 1 march, 2001. the houseless population was enumerated on 28 february. a revisional round was undertaken 1 to 5 march 2001 to account for mutations between the time of visit in february and 1 march.

the total population calculated for 1 march 2001 was  1,027,015,247, making the 2001 census the first to count more than a billion indians. the population had risen by 21.34% compared to the 1991 total. the female population had increased by 0.3 percentage points to 48.4%.

religious breakdown
censuses were conducted in india in ancient times with examples such as kautilya's arthashastra which describes the collection of population statistics for taxation. the british census in 1871 was the first conducted in modern times in india.

the 2001 census figures released by the india census commission give a breakdown by various parameters including religion.

 all figures in %. 
 gender ratio*: no of females/1000 males
 others includes jews, parsis and bahá'ís
 tribal animists (and non religious) are grouped under hindu after 1926 (1931 census onwards)

however, some unofficial estimates claim a higher figure of muslim population supposedly discounted in censuses. for instance, in an interview with a well circulated newspaper of india the hindu justice k.m. yusuf, a retired judge from calcutta high court and chairman of west bengal minority commission, says that the real percentage of muslims in india is at least 20%. . on the other hand, some believe that muslim population figures are exaggerated due to various reasons. for instance, as per syed shahabuddin, a diplomat-turned-politician, a muslim scholar and one of the members in the all india muslim personal law board, both hindu and muslim ‘spokesmen’, speaking for their respective communities amplify and exaggerate the muslim population in india, the first, to convince their followers about the rising ‘islamic menace’, a threat to the country and at least to its hindu character, the second, to raise the morale of a politically deprived, educationally backward, economically poor and socially vilified, frustrated community.

ethnic groups
unlike the usa, uk, and australian censuses, the national census of india does not recognize racial or ethnic groups within india.kumar, jayant. census of india. 2001. september 4, 2006. <http://www.censusindia.net/>. organizations and individual's not affiliated with india's national census have classified india into racial/ethnic groups. these racial and ethnic groups are debated main article historically-defined racial groups in india. the indian people are descended from more or less all of the ethnic groups that historically settled the subcontinent, including the dravidians, indo-aryans, achaemenid persians, indo-greeks, indo-scythians, indo-parthians, kushans, sassanid persians, indo-hepthalites, arabs, turks, afghans, mughals, portuguese, dutch, french and british. the imprint of each of these groups can be found in at least some small segment of the population, but at the same time over a long period of time these superficial differences in appearances have blurred to a great extent and everone either belong to hindu or other major religion in india. the framework of the culture of the indian people comes from these various people who laid the foundations of indian civilization as it is today.
