indonesia's 221 million people make it the world's fourth-most populous nation. the island of java is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with more than 107 million people living in an area the size of new york state.

indonesia includes numerous related but distinct cultural and linguistic groups, many of 
which are ethnically malay. since independence, indonesian (bahasa indonesia) (the national language, a form of malay) has spread throughout the archipelago and has become the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. many local languages are still important in many areas, however.
