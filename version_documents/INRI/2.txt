inri is an acronym of the latin phrase iesvs nazarenvs rex ivdæorvm, which translates to english as: "jesus the nazarene, king of the jews". it appears in the new testament of the christian bible in the gospel john (19:19). each of the other accounts for jesus' death have a slightly different sign: matthew (27:37) "this is jesus the king of the jews"; mark (15:26) "the king of the jews"; and luke (23:38) "this is the king of the jews". 

many crucifixes and other depictions of the crucifixion include a stylized plaque or parchment, called a titulus or title, bearing the letters inri, occasionally carved directly into the cross, and usually just above the figure of jesus.  

in the gospel of john (19:19–20) the inscription is explained:
and pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. and the writing was, jesus of nazareth the king of the jews. this title then read many of the jews: for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in hebrew, and greek, and latin. (king james version)

some eastern orthodox churches use the greek letters inbi based on the greek text of the inscription on the cross, . some other change the title to  (the king of the world), not implying that this was really what was written, but that it is what should have been written. also some other eastern orthodox churches (such as the romanian orthodox church) use the version inri. 

in hebrew, the phrase is commonly rendered ישוע הנצרי ומלך היהודים (yeshua` hanotsri u'melech hayehudim/ ). this is most probably in order that the acronym constitute the tetragrammaton (יהוה). it is possible that the titulus was written in aramaic, the local vernacular, rather than hebrew.

as pilate was loath to crucify jesus without justification, he used the standing roman treaty with the jews which allowed them limited self-government, see iudaea province for details.  when the jewish priests complained that jesus was interfering with that self-rule by claiming to be the son of god (see sanhedrin trial of jesus), pilate challenged him to deny that he was the "king of the jews".  jesus did not deny the accusation.  pilate's reluctance to crucify jesus, according to christian texts, stands in contrast to his willingness to crucify countless thousands of other jews and samaritans during his rule.josephus' antiquities of the jews 18

some believe that the justification for his crucifixion was his claim to an illegitimate title. however, john 19:21–22 kjv, alludes that pilate rejected the charge that jesus was crucified because he falsely claimed to be king and instead stated that jesus was crucified because he was the king of the jews. thus, some christians as early as the second centurytertullian, apologeticum c. gentes, a.d. 198, chapter 21 - http://www.tertullian.org/lfc/lfc10-06_apologeticum.htm#c21 report that pilate was convinced that jesus was the messiah.

 within the alchemical tradition, the phrase often holds a second meaning of the latin phrase, igne natura renovatur integra; that is, "through fire nature is reborn whole".
