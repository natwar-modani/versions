heimskringla is the old norse name of a collection of kings' sagas recorded in iceland around 1225 by the poet and historian snorri sturluson (1179â€“1242). the collection contains tales about the norwegian kings, beginning with the legendary swedish dynasty of the house of ynglings, followed by accounts of more historical norwegian rulers of the 10th to 12th centuries, up to the death of eystein meyla in 1177. 

scope
the heimskringla traces odin and his followers from the east, from asaland and asgard, its chief city, to their settlement in scandinavia. it narrates the contests of the kings, the establishment of the kingdoms of norway, sweden, and denmark, the viking expeditions and the conquests of england.  the stories are told with a life and freshness, giving a picture of human life in all its reality. the saga of olaf haraldsson is the main part. his 15 year long reign takes up about one third of the entire work. 

the saga of harold hardrada narrates his expedition to the east, his brilliant exploits in constantinople, syria, and sicily, his scaldic accomplishments, and his battles in england against harold, the son of earl godwin, where he fell at stamford bridge in 1066 only a few days before harold himself fell at the battle of hastings. this saga is a splendid epic in prose, and is also of particular relevance to the history of england. the first part of the heimskringla is rooted in norse mythology; as it advances, fable and fact all curiously intermingle, and it terminates in factual history. 

the heimskringla was translated into english by samuel laing in 1844. several modern editions are available.
