heimskringla is the icelandic name of a collection of sagas recorded in iceland around 1225 by the poet and historian snorri sturluson (1179-1242). the collection contains tales about the norwegian kings, beginning with the legendary swedish dynasty of the house of ynglings, followed by accounts of more historical norwegian rulers of the 10th to 12th centuries, up to the death of eystein eysteinson in 1177.

the heimskringla traces odin and his followers from the east, from asaland and asgard, its chief city, to their settlement in scandinavia. it narrates the contests of the kings, the establishment of the kingdoms of norway, sweden, and denmark, the viking expeditions, the discovery and settlement of iceland and greenland, the discovery of america, and the conquests of england and normandy. the stories are told with a life and freshness, giving a picture of human life in all its reality. some of the sagas of the "heimskringla" are romances, full of  adventures, while at the same time they lie completely within the range of history and may be regarded as authentic. the saga of olaf haraldson is the main part. his 15 year long reign takes up about one third of the entire work. that of harold hardrada narrates his expedition to the east, his brilliant exploits in constantinople, syria, and sicily, his scaldic accomplishments, and his battles in england against harold, the son of earl godwin, where he fell at stamford bridge in 1066 only a few days before harold himself fell at the battle of hastings. this saga is a splendid epic in prose, and is also of particular relevance to the history of england. the first part of the heimskringla is rooted in norse mythology; as it advances, fable and fact all curiously intermingle, and it terminates in factual history. the heimskringla was translated into english by samuel laing in 1844.

the heimskringla contains the following sagas (
