heimskringla is the icelandic name of the norse viking sagas and mythology, originally written in old norse around 1225 by the poet and historian snorri sturluson (c.1179-1241).

it traces odin and his followers from the east, from asaland and asgard, its chief city, to their settlement in scandinavia. it narrates the contests of the kings, the establishment of the kingdoms of norway, sweden, and denmark, the viking expeditions, the discovery and settlement of iceland and greenland, the discovery of america, and the conquests of england and normandy. the stories are told with a life and freshness that belong only to true genius, and a picture is given of human life in all its reality, genuine, vivid, and true. some of the sagas of the "heimskringla" are grand romances, full of brilliant adventures, while at the same time they lie so completely within the range of history that they may be regarded as authentic. that of harold hardrada narrates his expedition to the east, his brilliant exploits in constantinople, syria, and sicily, his scaldic accomplishments, and his battles in england against harold, the son of earl godwin, where he fell only a few days before godwin's son himself fell at the battle of hastings. this saga is a splendid epic in prose, and is particularly interesting to the english race. the first part of the "heimskringla" is necessarily derived from tradition; as it advances fable and fact all curiously intermingle, and it terminates in authentic history.

an english translation was made by samuel laing (london, 1844).
