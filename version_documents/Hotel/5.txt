a hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging, usually on a short-term basis and especially for tourists.  hotels often provide a number of additional guest services such as a restaurant, a swimming pool or childcare.  some hotels have conference services and encourage groups to hold conventions and meetings at their location.

hotels differ from motels in that most motels have drive-up, exterior entrances to the rooms, while hotels tend to have interior entrances to the rooms, making them safer and more relaxing to people.

origins of the term
the word hotel derives from the french hôtel, which originally referred to a french version of a townhouse, not a place offering accommodation (in contemporary usage, hôtel has the meaning of "hotel", and hôtel particulier is used for the old meaning). the french spelling (with the circumflex) was once also used in english, but is now rare. the circumflex replaces the 's' once preceding the 't' in the earlier hostel spelling, which over time received a new, but closely related meaning.

services and facilities
basic accommodation of a room with a bed, a cupboard, a small table and a washstand only has largely been replaced by rooms with en-suite bathrooms and climate control. other features found may be a telephone, an alarm clock, a tv, and broadband internet connectivity. food and drink may be supplied by a mini-bar (which often includes a small refrigerator) containing snacks and drinks (to be paid for on departure), and tea and coffee making facilities (cups, spoons, an electric kettle and sachets containing instant coffee, tea bags, sugar, and creamer or milk).

in the united kingdom a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all-comers within certain stated hours; to avoid this requirement it is not uncommon to come across "private hotels" which are not subject to this requirement.

however, in japan the capsule hotel supplies minimal facilities and room space.

classification
the cost and quality of hotels are usually indicative of the range and type of services available. due to the enormous increase in tourism worldwide during the last decades of the 20th century, standards, especially those of smaller establishments, have improved considerably. for the sake of greater comparability, rating systems have been introduced, with the one to five stars classification being most common.

boutique hotels

"boutique hotel" is a term originating in north america to describe intimate, usually luxurious or quirky hotel environments. boutique hotels differentiate themselves from larger chain or branded hotels by providing an exceptional and personalized level accommodation, services and facilities.

typically boutique hotels are furnished in a themed, stylish and/or aspirational manner. although usually considerably smaller than a mainstream hotel (ranging from 3 to 100 guest rooms) boutique hotels are generally fitted with telephony and wi-fi internet connections, honesty bars and often cable/pay tv. guest services are attended to by 24 hour hotel staff. many boutique hotels have on site dining facilities, and the majority offer bars and lounges which may also be open to the general public.

of the total travel market a small percentage are discerning travelers, who place a high importance on privacy, luxury and service delivery. as this market is typically corporate travelers, the market segment is referral-rich, non-seasonal, high-yielding and repeat, and therefore one which boutique hotel operators target as their primary source of income.

famous hotels
some hotels are well known because they had famous clientele or are frequent hideaways for stars. the beverly hills hotel is known for it's a-list guests, and the chateu marmont is known for it's hollywood guests. more recently, the nob hill hotel is known for more current guests including musicians playing at clubs two blocks away such as george clinton and marylin manson.
