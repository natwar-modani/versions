for more than two decades there have been plans for building a metro system in baghdad. it is possible that part of the tunnels have been built, but that they are now used militarily for sheltering, hiding and escaping purposes. u.n. inspectors have heard of the tunnels for years, but have not found their entrances.  map    in november, 2008, an overground service dubbed the baghdad metro began service.  

the first iraqi republic railways train to basra since the overthrow of saddam hussein's regime arrived on april 26 2003.  british troops hope to use the 68 km long railway to transport much-needed aid supplies from the port town of umm qasr to basra.
