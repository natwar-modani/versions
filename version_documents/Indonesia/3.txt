 history 
main article: history of indonesia

under influence of buddhism, several kingdoms formed on the islands of sumatra and java from the 7th to 14th century. the arrival of arab traders later brought islam, which became the dominant religion.

when the europeans came in the early 16th century, they found a multitude of small states. these were vulnerable to the europeans, who were in pursuit of dominating the spice trade. in the 17th century, the dutch emerged as the most powerful of the europeans, ousting the british and portuguese (except for timor). 

after the dutch east india company was liquidated, its possesions in indonesia were taken over by the dutch government. after japanese occupation ended in 1945, the indonesians declared independence, led by sukarno. the dutch finally accepted in 1949, and sukarno became the country's first president.

after sukarno's autocratic rule was almost overthrown, army leader suharto became president in 1968. suharto enriched himself, but the nation grew poorer, and he was forced to step down after massive demonstrations in 1998. the country currently suffers from internal religious struggles and several regions striving for independence (aceh, irian jaya).

 geography 
main article: geography of indonesia

indonesia's 17,000 islands (ca. 6,000 are inhabited) are scattered around the equator, giving the country a tropical climate. the largest islands are java, where about half of the population lives, sumatra, borneo (partially malaysian), irian jaya (western half of new guinea) and sulawesi.

its location on the edges of tectonic plates means indonesia is frequently hit by earthquakes and the resulting tsunamis. indonesia is also rich in volcanoes, the most famous being the now disappeared krakatau (krakatoa).
