a hotspot is a center of high activity within a larger area of low activity. the term is applied to different things in different contexts:

 in geology, a hotspot is a location on the earth's surface that has vulcanism for a long period of time. originally thought to be caused by a narrow stream of hot mantle convecting up from the mantle-core boundary , the latest geological evidence is pointing to upper-mantle convection as a cause . geologists have identified some 40-50 such hotspots, with hawai'i, yellowstone, and iceland overlying the most currently active.  
 in genetics, a hotspot can be
 a position on the dna where mutations occur with an unusual high frequency
 a position on the dna where recombination occurs with an unusual high frequency
 in meteorology, a hotspot is an area where the atmosphere is relatively hot. examples of hotspots include the air over a desert or the region of jupiter where the galileo probe's atmospheric sub-probe descended.
 a hotspot is a wi-fi access point or area, in particular for connecting to internet.
