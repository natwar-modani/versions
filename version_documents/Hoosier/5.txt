origin of the word
according to the oxford english dictionary, the etymology of the word is unknown, but it has been in use since at least 1826.  according to bill bryson, there are many suggestions for the derivation of the word "hoosier," but none is universally accepted.

it first came into general usage in the 1830s. john finley of richmond, indiana wrote a poem, the hoosier's nestthe hoosier's nest, which was used as the "carrier's address" of the indianapolis journal, january 1, 1833. as it came into common usage, the debates about the term's origin began.indiana historical society.

some folkloric etymologies
frontier banter
this idea suggests the term was a greeting. when approaching a man's home in those early frontier days, you shouted from afar, "hello, the cabin!" to avoid being shot. the inhabitants would then shout back "who'sh 'ere?" (who's there). as it got slurred together over time, the country folk came to be called hoosiers.

a variant of this story combines "who's" and "your", such as in "who'sh yer 'pa?".  additionally, the poet james whitcomb riley facetiously suggested that the fierce brawling that took place in indiana involved enough ear biting that the expression "whose ear?" was common enough to be notable.

pugilistic boatmen
indiana rivermen were so spectacularly successful in trouncing or "hushing" their adversaries in the brawling that was then common that they became known as "hushers."

mr. hoosier's men
[[image:picture 1650.jpg|thumb|right|300px|one possible origin of the term "hoosier" comes from the construction of the louisville and portland canal]]
a contractor reportedly named samuel hoosier preferred to hire workers from indiana during the construction of the louisville and portland canal (1826-1831) in louisville.  his employees became known as "hoosier's men" and finally just "hoosiers."

this story is reported by dunn (1907:16-17) as being told in 1901 by a man who heard this story from a hoosier family member while traveling in southern tennessee.  however, dunn’s research could find no-one in southern tennessee who had heard the story, nor could he find any family of that name in any directory in the region.  in spite of dunn’s skepticism, this version has been accepted by evan bayh, who has served as indiana governor and senator, and by senator vance hartke, who introduced this story into the congressional record (1975), according to graf.

a similar story involves the national road, which began in cumberland, maryland, and slowly extended westward, reaching indiana in 1829-1834.  as plans were made to extend the highway to richmond, indiana, the call went out for laborers. knowing that the federal government would pay "top dollar," the employees of a contractor in the indiana territory reportedly named robert hoosier asked their boss if they could go work for this higher wage in the neighboring state of ohio. mr. hoosier gave his consent, asking them to return to work for him when this section of the road was done. 

just as in the sam hoosier story, the crew of indiana workers proved to be industrious, conscientious, and efficient. the federal foreman referred to the group as "hoosiers" meaning they were workers that robert hoosier had allowed to join the national work crew. it wasn't long before people along the national road used the term to describe the folks living in the territory to the west.

this story is not mentioned in dunn’s or mencken’s research, but if there were such a contractor and such events, they would have taken place after the term “hoosier” was already well established in appalachia and was becoming attached to indiana.

hussars
in this story, a veteran of the napoleonic wars, col. john jacob lehmanowsky, settled in indiana later in life and gave lectures on the “wars of europe” in which he extolled the virtues of the hussars, which his audience heard as “hoosiers.”  young men wishing to identify with these virtues called themselves hoosiers, enough of them that eventually all indianans were called hoosiers.  

weaknesses of this story include the unlikely mispronunciation of hussar as hoosier and the fact that lehmanowsky did not come to indiana until 1833, by which time the term was already well established.
