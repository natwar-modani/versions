israel is located at the eastern end of the mediterranean sea. it is bounded on the north by lebanon, on the northeast by syria, on the east and southeast by jordan, on the southwest by egypt, and on the west by the mediterranean sea. before june 1967, the area composing israel (resulting from the armistice lines of 1949 and 1950) was about 20,700 square kilometers (8,000 mi²), which included 445 square kilometers (172 mi²) of inland water. thus israel was roughly the size of the state of new jersey, stretching 424 kilometers (263 mi) from north to south. its width ranged from 114 kilometers (71 mi) to, at its narrowest point, 10 kilometers (6.2 mi). after the june 1967 war, israel occupied territories totaling an additional 7,099 square kilometers (2,743 mi²). these territories include the west bank, 5,879 square kilometers (2,270 mi²); east jerusalem (annexed, according israeli law), 70 km² (27 mi²); and the golan heights (de facto annexation), 1,150 km² (444 mi²).

physical geography
topography
the country is divided into four regions: the coastal plain, the central hills, the jordan rift valley, and the negev desert. the mediterranean coastal plain stretches from the lebanese border in the north to gaza in the south, interrupted only by cape carmel at haifa bay. it is about forty kilometers wide at gaza and narrows toward the north to about five kilometers at the lebanese border. the region is fertile and humid (historically malarial) and is known for its citrus and viniculture. the plain is traversed by several short streams, of which only two, the yarqon and qishon, have permanent water flows.

east of the coastal plain lies the central highland region. in the north of this region lie the mountains and hills of upper galilee and lower galilee; farther to the south are the samarian hills with numerous small, fertile valleys; and south of jerusalem are the mainly barren hills of judea. the central highlands average 610 meters (2,000 ft) in height and reach their highest elevation at mount meron, at 1,208 meters (3,963 ft), in galilee near zefat (safad). several valleys cut across the highlands roughly from east to west; the largest is the yizreel or jezreel valley (also known as the plain of esdraelon), which stretches forty-eight kilometers (30 mi) from haifa southeast to the valley of the jordan river, and is nineteen kilometers across at its widest point.

east of the central highlands lies the jordan rift valley, which is a small part of the 6,500-kilometer-long (4,040 mi) syrian-east african rift. in israel the rift valley is dominated by the jordan river, lake tiberias (known also as the sea of galilee and to israelis as lake kinneret), and the dead sea. the jordan, israel's largest river (322 km / 200 mi), originates in the dan, baniyas, and hasbani rivers near mount hermon in the anti-lebanon mountains and flows south through the drained hula basin into the freshwater lake tiberias. lake tiberias is 165 square kilometers (63.7 mi²) in size and, depending on the season and rainfall, is at about 213 meters (700 ft) below sea level. with a water capacity estimated at 3 cubic kilometers (106 billion cubic feet), it serves as the principal reservoir of the national water carrier (also known as the kinneret-negev conduit). the jordan river continues its course from the southern end of lake tiberias (forming the boundary between the west bank and jordan) to its terminus in the highly saline dead sea. the dead sea is 1,020 square kilometers (393 mi²) in size and, at 399 meters (1,309 ft) below sea level, is the lowest point in the world. south of the dead sea, the rift valley continues in the nahal haarava (wadi al arabah in arabic), which has no permanent water flow, for 170 kilometers (106 mi) to the gulf of aqaba.

the negev desert comprises approximately 12,000 square kilometers (4,600 mi²), more than half of israel's total land area. geographically it is an extension of the sinai desert, forming a rough triangle with its base in the north near beersheba (aka beersheva), the dead sea, and the southern judean hills, and it has its apex in the southern tip of the country at eilat. topographically, it parallels the other regions of the country, with lowlands in the west, hills in the central portion, and the nahal haarava as its eastern border.

 elevation extremes
 lowest point: dead sea -408 m (-1,339 ft)
 highest point: har hermon at 2,248 m (7,375 ft) in the unilaterally annexed golan heights or har meron at 1,208 m (3,963 ft) within the 1967 boundaries.

climate
israel has a mediterranean climate characterized by long, hot, dry summers and short, cool, rainy winters, as modified locally by altitude and latitude. summers are very humid along the mediterranean coast but dry in the negev. the climate is determined by israel's location between the subtropical aridity characteristic of egypt and the subtropical humidity of the levant or eastern mediterranean. january is the coldest month, with average temperatures ranging from 5 °c to 12 °c (41 °f to 54 °f), and august is the hottest month at 18 °c to 38 °c (64 °f to 100 °f). in eilat, the desert city, in the summer the temperatures are the highest in the country. but the dry air makes it very pleasant. more than 70 percent of the average rainfall in the country falls between november and march; june through september are often rainless. rainfall is unevenly distributed, decreasing sharply as one moves southward. in the extreme south, rainfall averages less than 50 millimeters (2 in) annually; in the north, average annual rainfall exceeds 900 millimeters (35 in). rainfall varies from season to season and from year to year, particularly in the negev desert. precipitation is often concentrated in violent storms, causing erosion and flooding. during january and february, it may take the form of snow at the higher elevations of the central highlands, including jerusalem. the areas of the country most cultivated are those that receive more than 300 millimeters (12 in) of rainfall annually; about one-third of the country is cultivable.

human geography
in 2005 the total population of the israeli inhabited places is estimated at 6.9 million. depending on the definitions applied, there were three to five metropolises, which included some of israel's 71 cities and hundreds of towns. 

among israel's villages, the kibbutzim and moshavim are unique types of settlement to israel. there are 242 israeli settlements and civilian land use sites in the west bank, 42 in the israeli-occupied golan heights, and 29 in east jerusalem (february 2002 est.);

urban geography
israeli metropolises are tel aviv, haifa and beer sheva and possibly also jerusalem  and nazareth .

in 2005 there are 71 israeli cities, including 3 israeli cities in the west bank. (see list of cities in israel). the status of city is awarded by the israeli minister of internal affairs to settlements that apply for this status and usually pass a threshold of 20.000, although the minister can give and in some cases does give out the status beforehand. 

israeli towns of 5.000 residents and more are incorporated as "local councils". most towns between 2.000 and 5.000 residents are local committees within regional councils, although exceptions exist.

rural geography
israel's rural space includes several unique kinds of settlements, notably the moshav and the kibbutz. originally these were collective and cooperative settlements respectively. over time, the degree of cooperation in these settlements has reduced and in several of them the cooperative structure was dismantled altogether. all rural settlements and many small towns (some of which are dubbed "rurban settlements") are incorporated in regional councils.
