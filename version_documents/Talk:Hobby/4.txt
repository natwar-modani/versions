are porter blanchard and arthur stone silversmithing hobbyists, or professionals?  i really really think that a list of famous hobbyists is inappropriate, and professionals certainly don't belong here, either. --michaeltinkler

imho a new section under "visual arts and design" called something like "traditional crafts". included would be areas like silversmith, glass working, blacksmith, and woodworking.

traditional visual arts: 

painting 
drawing 
sculpture 
photography 
crafts **here**

design: 

[fashion design]? 
graphic design 
[interior decoration]? 
crafts *here* (or maybe here)
[industrial design]? 

i am not sure describing a hobby as spare-time is politically correct. i think we should describe it as recreational. 

isn't it important to add a section on "importance of hobby in human life" - as it is commonly observed that people without a 'serious' hobby often die of boredom after they retire ;). hobbies make life more meaningful and satisfying for many people. a section is needed.

 etymology of hobby 

the etymology section for the word "hobby" seems very unsatisfactory to me. why is a hobby horse called a hobby horse? where does the hobby part come from?
