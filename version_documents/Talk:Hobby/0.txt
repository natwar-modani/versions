are porter blanchard and arthur stone silversmithing hobbyists, or professionals?  i really really think that a list of famous hobbyists is inappropriate, and professionals certainly don't belong here, either. --michaeltinkler

imho a new section under "visual arts and design" called something like "traditional crafts". included would be areas like silversmith, glass working, blacksmith, and woodworking.

traditional visual arts: 

painting 
drawing 
sculpture 
photography 
crafts **here**

design: 

[fashion design]? 
graphic design 
[interior decoration]? 
crafts *here* (or maybe here)
[industrial design]? 

i am not sure describing a hobby as spare-time is politically correct. i think we should describe it as recreational.
