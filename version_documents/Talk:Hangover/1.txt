describe the new page here.
i am quite concerned about my drinking...i am definately not a typical alcoholic cos when i have a hangover it puts me off drink for at least three days...but it always creeps back in and socially, i find it hard to resist going on the "piss" with my friends every weekend. its going on about 8 years of hard drinking every weekend and im only 23.i know i have the willpower to stop, and i am seriously considering it after this weekend seeing as i really went overboard and thought i was going to die i felt so awful the next day.
can you tell me if i have already gone too far? i am scared of the damage i am causing myself...my liver and kidneys etc. my email address is twentiesgal@hotmail.com i d really appreciate if someone could email me back about this...
best regards.
