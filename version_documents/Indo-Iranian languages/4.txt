the indo-iranian languages, also known as the aryan languages, constitute the easternmost extant branch of the indo-european language family. it is also the largest branch, with more than a billion speakers stretching from europe (romani) and the caucasus (ossetian) eastward to xinjiang (sarikoli) and assam (assamese) and south to sri lanka (sinhalese).

languages
indo-iranian consists of three groups: 
indo-aryan

history
indo-iranian languages were once spoken across a still wider area. the scythians were described by roman writer strabo as inhabiting the lands to the north of the black sea in present-day ukraine, moldova and romania. the river-names don, dnieper, danube etc. are possibly of indo-iranian origin. the so-called migration period saw indo-iranian languages disappear from eastern europe, apart from the ancestors of ossetian in the caucasus, with the arrival of the turkic-speaking pechenegs and others by the eighth century ad. 

sanskrit was widely spoken throughout southeast asia from 7th century onwards  due to indian trade and colonization.

the oldest attested indo-iranian languages are vedic sanskrit (ancient indo-aryan), older and younger avestan and old persian (ancient iranian languages). but there are written instances of a fourth language in northern mesopotamia (see indo-aryan superstrate in mitanni) most closely related to indo-aryan. it is attested in documents from the ancient  mitanni kingdom and the hittites of anatolia.
