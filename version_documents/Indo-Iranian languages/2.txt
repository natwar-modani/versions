the indo-iranian language group constitutes the easternmost extant branch of the indo-european family of languages. it consists of three language groups: the indo-aryan (including  dardic), iranian and  nuristani. the term aryan languages is  occasionally still used to refer to the indo-iranian languages numeral types and changes worldwide, by jadranka (edt) gvozdanovic, language arts & disciplines,1999, page 221. the speakers of the proto-indo-iranian language, the hypothetical proto-indo-iranians, are usually associated with the late 3rd millennium bc sintashta-petrovka culture of central asia. their expansion is believed to have been connected with the invention of the chariot. 

the contemporary indo-iranian languages form the largest sub-branch of indo-european, with more than one billion speakers in total, stretching from europe (romani) and the caucasus (ossetian) to xinjiang (sariqoli) and  east india. sil in a 2005 estimate counts a total of 308 varieties, the largest in terms of native speakers being hindustani (hindi and urdu, ca. 540 million), bengali (ca. 200 million), punjabi (ca. 80 million),
marathi and persian (ca. 70 million each), gujarati (ca. 45 million), pashto (40 million), oriya (ca. 30 million), kurdish (ca. 40 million) and sindhi (ca. 20 million ).

indo-iranian languages were once spoken across a wider area still. the scythians were described by roman writer strabo as inhabiting the lands to the north of the black sea in present-day ukraine, moldova and romania. the river-names don, dnieper, danube etc. are of indo-iranian origin. the so-called migration period saw indo-iranian languages disappear from eastern europe with the arrival of the turkic-speaking pechenegs and others by the eighth century ad.
