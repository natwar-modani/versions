history
indo-iranian languages were once spoken across an even wider area. the scythians, were described by roman writer strabo as inhabiting the lands to the north of the black sea in present-day ukraine, moldova and romania. the river-names don, dnieper, danube etc. are possibly of indo-iranian origin. the so-called migration period saw indo-iranian languages disappear from eastern europe, apart from the ancestor of ossetian in the caucasus, with the arrival of the turkic-speaking pechenegs and others by the 8th century ad.

sanskrit was widely spoken throughout southeast asia from 7th century onwards  due to indian trade and colonization.

the oldest attested indo-iranian languages are vedic sanskrit (ancient indo-aryan), older and younger avestan and old persian (ancient iranian languages). a few words from a fourth language (very closely related to indo-aryan; see indo-aryan superstrate in mitanni) are attested in documents from the ancient mitanni kingdom in northern mesopotamia and syria and the hittite kingdom in anatolia.
