haggai (, ḥaggay or "hag-i", koine greek: ἀγγαῖος; ) was a jewish prophet during the building of the second temple in jerusalem, and one of the twelve minor prophets in the hebrew bible and the author of the book of haggai. his name means "my holiday". he was the first of three prophets (with zechariah, his contemporary, and malachi, who lived about one hundred years later), who belonged to the period of  jewish history which began after the return from captivity in babylon.

scarcely anything is known of his personal history. he may have been one of the captives taken to babylon by nebuchadnezzar. he began his ministry about sixteen years after the return of the jews to judah (ca. 520 bce). the work of rebuilding the temple had been put to a stop through the intrigues of the samaritans. after having been suspended for eighteen years, the work was resumed through the efforts of haggai and zechariah. they exhorted the people, which roused them from their lethargy, and induced them to take advantage of a change in the policy of the persian government under darius the great.

the name haggai, with various vocalizations, is also found in the book of esther, as a eunuch servant of the queen.
