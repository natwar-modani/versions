herstory is a neologism coined in the late 1960s as part of a feminist critique of conventional historiography. in feminist discourse the term refers to history (ironically restated as "his story") written from a feminist perspective, emphasizing the role of women, or told from a woman's point of view. (the word history (from the ancient greek ιστορία, or istoria, meaning "a learning or knowing by inquiry") is etymologically unrelated to the possessive pronoun his.)

usage
the word has been used in feminist literature since its inception.  at present, herstory is considered an "economical way" to describe feminist efforts against a male-centered canon.robert j. belton, words of art (2002). the oxford english dictionary credits robin morgan with coining the term in her 1970 book, sisterhood is powerful. concerning the feminist organization witch, morgan writes:

the fluidity and wit of the witches is evident in the ever-changing acronym: the basic, original title was women's international terrorist conspiracy from hell [...] and the latest heard at this writing is women inspired to commit herstory."herstory", oxford english dictionary online (oxford university press, 2006).

in 1976, casey miller and kate swift wrote in words & women, 
when women in the movement use herstory, their purpose is to emphasize that women's lives, deeds, and participation in human affairs have been neglected or undervalued in standard histories.

during the 1970s and 1980s, second-wave feminists saw the study of history as a male-dominated intellectual enterprise and presented "herstory" as a means of compensation.devoney looser, british women writers and the writing of history (johns hopkins university press: 2000).  isbn 0-8018-6448-8.  the term, intended to be both serious and comic,angus calder and lizbeth goodman, "gender and poetry", in literature and gender, ed. by lizbeth goodman (routledge: 1996).  isbn 0-415-13573-7. became a rallying cry used on t-shirts and buttons as well as in academia; the notions of herstory prompted changes in school curricula.  

 criticism 
scholars have contended that using the term effectively blinds the modern learner from the important contributions women made to historical scholarship in the nineteenth century and before.

the global language monitor, a nonprofit group that analyzes and tracks trends in language, named herstory the third most politically incorrect word of 2006--rivaled only by "macaca" and "global warming denier." global language monitor web page (2006)
