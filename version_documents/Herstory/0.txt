herstory refers to history from a feminist perspective. the term originates as a pun on the word history, replacing "his" story with "her" story. this term, even when used by most feminists, is meant in jest rather than from an actual desire to change the standard spelling of the word. herstory does not mean the same thing as women's history.

the element "his" in the word history, however, is not actually related to the english third person masculine possessive pronoun his.
