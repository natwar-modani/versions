herstory refers to history from a feminist perspective. the term originates as a pun on the word history, replacing "his" story with "her" story. this term, even when used by most feminists, is meant in jest rather than from an actual desire to change the standard spelling of the word. herstory does not mean the same thing as women's history.

the element "his" in the word history, however, is not actually related to the english third person masculine possessive pronoun his. it derives from the ancient greek word for 'investigation'.

the feminist who “etymologised” history as his story and proposed herstory as an antidote was not serious about the linguistics of the matter, but she was entirely serious about the gender-political point (male domination of history), which she communicated all the more effectively because of her good-humoured etymological fake. the term womanipulate for manipulate as man-ipulate (actually latin manipulare, “to handle”, from manus, “hand”) was created in the same way.
