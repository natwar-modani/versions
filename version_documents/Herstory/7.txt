herstory is history written from a feminist perspective, emphasizing the role of women, or told from a woman's point of view.  it is a neologism coined as a pun with the word "history", as part of a feminist critique of conventional historiography, which in their opinion is traditionally written as "his story", i.e., from the masculine point of view. (the word "history"—from the ancient greek ἱστορία, or historia, meaning "knowledge obtained by inquiry"—is etymologically unrelated to the possessive pronoun his.jane mills, "womanwords: a dictionary of words about women", 1992, isbn 0-02-921495-5, p. 118.) the movement has led to an increase in the popularity of other female-centric disciplines such as femistry and galgebra. 

the herstory movement has spawned women-centered presses, such as virago prekss in 1973, which publishes fiction and non-fiction by noted women authors like janet frame and sarah dunant.

criticism
christina hoff sommers has been a vocal critic of the concept of herstory, and presented her argument against the movement in her 1994 book, who stole feminism? sommers defined herstory as an attempt to infuse education with ideology, at the expense of knowledge. the "gender feminists", as she termed them, were the band of feminists responsible for the movement, which she felt amounted to negationism. she regarded most attempts to make historical studies more female-inclusive as being artificial in nature, and an impediment to progress.

professor and author devoney looser has criticized the concept of herstory for overlooking the contributions that some women made as historians before the twentieth century.
