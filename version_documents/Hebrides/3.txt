this article is about the hebrides islands in scotland.  see also the new hebrides for the islands constituting vanuatu.

the hebrides comprise a spread-out and diverse group of islands off the west coast of scotland, and in geological terms are composed of the oldest rocks in the british isles.  they can be divided into two groups:

 inner hebrides, including skye, mull, islay, jura and the small isles
 outer hebrides, including lewis and harris, north uist, south uist and saint kilda

the hebrides as a whole are sometimes referred to as the western isles, but this term is more accurately applied just to the outer hebrides.

the hebrides are probably the best-known group of scottish islands, but other groups include the islands of the lower firth of clyde and the northern isles.

hebrides overture, also known as fingal's cave overture, is a famous overture written by felix mendelssohn while residing on these islands.
