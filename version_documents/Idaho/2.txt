idaho is state located in the northwestern united states. its capital is boise and the u.s. postal abbreviation is id.

uss idaho was named in honor of this state.

 history 
on march 4, 1863, president abraham lincoln signed an act creating idaho territory. idaho was visited by lewis and clark in 1805. at that time, approximately 8,000 native americans lived in the region. originally part of oregon  and washington territories, fur trading and missionary work attracted the first settlers to the region. while thousands passed through idaho during the california gold rush of 1849, few people settled there. when organized as a territory in 1863, the total population was under 17,000.

the political stability of the territorial period encouraged settlement. almost immediately, a public school system was created, stage coach lines were established and a newspaper, the idaho statesman, began publication. in 1865, boise replaced lewiston as capital. the 1866 discovery of gold in idaho and the completion of the transcontinental railway in 1869 brought many new people to the territory, including chinese laborers who came to work the mines. when president benjamin harrison signed the law admitting idaho as a u.s. state on july 3, 1890, the population was 88,548. interestingly, the state still operates under its original (1889) state constitution.

as idaho approached statehood, mining and other extractive industries became increasingly important to her economy. by the 1890s, for example, idaho exported more lead than any other state. although idaho's dependence on mining has decreased, the state remains a top producer of silver and lead. today, idaho's industrial economy is growing, as plants are built to process the state's rich agricultural and natural resources.
