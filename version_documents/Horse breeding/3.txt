horse breeding is the process of using selective breeding to produce additional individuals of a given phenotype, that is, continuing a breed. alternatively, a breeder could, using individuals of differing phenotypes, create a new breed, with specific characteristics.

beyond phenotype (appearance and conformation) of horses, breeders aspire to improve physical performance abilities. this has led to the development of families or bloodlines within breeds that are specialists for excelling in specific events.

an example of this is horses that are bred to excel in a performance event called "cutting." this event favors horses that are intelligent, have an ability to think independently, who are somewhat short in stature, and who possess a quality known as "cowsense."

another example would be horses that are bred to excel in an event called "hunter under saddle," "english pleasure," or "hunter on the flat." this event favors animals that are tall and leggy, who are able to trot and canter smoothly and efficiently while giving the equestrian a comfortable ride.
