indonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago with thousands of islands, and the distribution of its more than 200 million people highly concentrated on a single island which is javaindonesia's diversity revisited http://cip.cornell.edu/dienst/ui/1.0/summarize/seap.indo/1107012385.

all transport modes play a role in the country’s transport system and are generally complementary rather than competitive.
road transport is predominant, with a total system length of 437,759 km in 2008.
the railway system has four unconnected networks in java and sumatra primarily dedicated to transport bulk commodities and long-distance passenger traffic.
sea transport is extremely important for economic integration and for domestic and foreign trade. it is well developed, with each of the major islands having at least one significant port city.
the role of inland waterways is relatively minor and is limited to certain areas of eastern sumatra and kalimantan.
the function of air transport is significant, particularly where land or water transport is deficient or non-existent. it is based on an extensive domestic airline network where all major cities can be reached by passenger plane.

because indonesia encompasses a sprawling archipelago, maritime shipping provides essential links between different parts of the country.  boats in common use include large container ships, a variety of ferries, passenger ships, sailing ships, and smaller motorized vessels. traditional wooden vessel pinisi still widely used as the inter-island freight service within indonesian archipelago. main pinisi traditional harbours is sunda kelapa in jakarta and paotere harbour in makassar.

frequent ferry services cross the straits between nearby islands, especially in the chain of islands stretching from sumatra through java to the lesser sunda islands. on the busy crossings between sumatra, java, and bali, multiple car ferries run frequently twenty-four hours per day. there are also international ferry services between across the straits of malacca between sumatra and malaysia, and between singapore and nearby indonesian islands, such as batam.

a network of passenger ships makes longer connections to more remote islands, especially in the eastern part of the archipelago. the national shipping line, pelni, provides passenger service to ports throughout the country on a two to four week schedule.  these ships generally provide the least expensive way to cover long distances between islands.  still smaller privately run boats provide service between islands.  

on some islands, major rivers provide a key transportation link in the absence of good roads. on kalimantan, longboats running on the rivers are the only way to reach many inland areas.

waterways
indonesia has 21,579 km of navigable waterways (), of which about one half are on kalimantan, and a quarter each on sumatra and papua. waterways are highly needed because the rivers on these islands are not wide enough to hold medium-sized ships. in addition to this, roads and railways are not good options since kalimantan and papua are not like java, which is a highly developed islandpolitics and business indonesia http://kerrycollison.net/index.php?/archives/2805-politics-and-business-mix-in-indonesia.html. with the current length of waterways, indonesia ranked seven on the countries with longest waterways rank order - waterways https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2093rank.html.

 ports and harbours 

major ports and harbors include cilacap, cirebon, jakarta, kupang, palembang, semarang, surabaya, and makassar. ports are managed by the various indonesia port corporations, of which there are four, numbered i through iv. each has jurisdiction over various regions of the country, with i in the west and iv in the east.

 roads and highways

[[image:jakartatransjakartafahrzeuglackierungen.jpg|thumb|right|transjakarta bus rapid transit.]]
a wide variety of vehicles are used for transportation on indonesia's roads. bus services are available in most areas connected to the road network.  between major cities, especially on sumatra, java, and bali, services are frequent and direct; many services are available with no stops until the final destination.  in more remote areas, and between smaller towns, most services are provided with minibuses or minivans (angkut). buses and vans are also the primary form of transportation within cities. often, these are operated as share taxis, running semi-fixed routes.

many cities and towns have some form of transportation for hire available as well, such as taxis, bus rapid transit system (such as transjakarta), and motorized autorickshaws (bajaj). cycle rickshaws, called becak in indonesia, are common in many cities, and provide an inexpensive form of in-town transportation. they have been blamed for causing traffic congestion and banned from most parts of central jakarta. horse-drawn carts are found in some cities and towns.

due to the increasing purchasing power of indonesians, private cars are becoming more common especially in major cities. however the growth of the number of cars increasingly outpaces the construction of new roads, resulting in frequently crippling traffic jams in large parts in major cities especially in jakarta, which often also happen on highways. 

the ah2 highway is one of indonesia's main highways. the other one is ah25 in sumatra.

indonesia has about 213,649 km of paved highways and about 154,711 km of unpaved highways ( estimate).

indonesia has some highways, some of them are national routes (25, currently only in java), and some of them are freeways. all the freeways are tolled (toll road). the most expensive is the cipularang toll road that connects jakarta and bandung.

 railways

most railways in indonesia are on java, which has two major rail lines that run the length of the island, as well as several minor lines. passenger and freight service runs on all of the lines. there is also commuter rail service in the jakarta metropolitan area, known as krl jabotabek and surabaya and the vicinities. in 2008, the government under pt kereta api and angkasa pura planned to built the airport railway from soekarno-hatta airport to manggarai (jakarta). a monorail mass transit system is under construction in jakarta. 

the only other areas in indonesia having railroads are three separate regions of sumatra, one in the north around medan, second in the west sumatra from pariaman to padang and the other in the southern trip, from lubuk linggau (south sumatra) to bandar lampung, (lampung).

in 2010, the island of kalimantan is to get a 122km long railway for the transport of coal.  railway gazette international november 2010, p56

air transportation in indonesia is important to connect thousands of islands spread throughout archipelago. however safety issue still remains a problem. several accidents happened in 2006–2007 has made indonesia air transportation safety among the lowest with global average of 0.25 in 2007."safety woeful, admits air chief." sydney morning herald online, november 2, 2007 - 2:17pm.
