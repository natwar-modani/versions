equation (cartesian): ((x-a)/c)^2 - ((y-b)/d)^2 = 1 equation (cartesian): ((x-a)/c)^2 - ((y-b)/d)^2 = -1 

equation (cartesian): y-a = c/(x-b) equation (cartesian): y-a = -c/(x-b) 

equation (polar): r^2 = a sec 2t equation (polar): r^2 = -a sec 2t 

equation (polar): r^2 = a csc 2t equation (polar): r^2 = -a csc 2t
