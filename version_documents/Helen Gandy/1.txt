miss helen gandy was the personal secretary to j. edgar hoover during most 
of j. edgar's tenure as fbi director.  miss gandy kept the most sensitive 
of j. edgar's personal files in her office, instead of hoover's, thus when 
hoover died, nixon's order's to seal hoover's office were inconsequential and
miss gandy was able to destroy a large amount of material.
