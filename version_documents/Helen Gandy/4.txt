helen w. gandy was the personal secretary to fbi director j. edgar hoover from the time he became director in the 1920s until his death in 1972.  she kept the most sensitive 
of j. edgar's personal files in her office, instead of hoover's; thus when hoover died, nixon's orders to seal hoover's office were inconsequential and gandy was able to destroy a large amount of material.  however, in a congressional hearing on the fate of hoover's files, miss gandy denied destroying any government files, stating she had only destroyed her boss's personal papers.  miss gandy never married.
