 lycanthropy 

concerning lycanthropy and the use of hallucinogenic drugs, frida g. surawicz and richard banta wrote "in the first case, this was brought on by lsd and strychnine and continued casual marijuana use... concerning drugs as causative agents, it is interesting to note that opium has been mentioned in a dual capacity, namely as a drug which can cause lycanthropy as well as a drug for its treatment." -- i don't believe that this really belongs here, as this is certainly not a typical nor a traditional hallucinogen experience. --thoric (talk) 18:32, 24 october 2018 (utc)
well, deliriant drugs like brugmansia, datura, hyoscyamus, mandragora, and belladonna can make persons believe they are animals. i've read that if you tell them they are pigs they start to behave like pigs. they loose their will and the contact to reality, and their memory. they do not know what they are doing whatever they do. the alkaloids of these plants, as well as further anticholinergics suppress the ability to distiguish dream and reality. it is strongly recommended not to use such stuffs for recreational purposes because nobody knows what will happen. --fk1954 (talk) 16:23, 18 january 2019 (utc)
