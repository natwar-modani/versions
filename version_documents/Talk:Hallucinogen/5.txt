 lycanthropy 

concerning lycanthropy and the use of hallucinogenic drugs, frida g. surawicz and richard banta wrote "in the first case, this was brought on by lsd and strychnine and continued casual marijuana use... concerning drugs as causative agents, it is interesting to note that opium has been mentioned in a dual capacity, namely as a drug which can cause lycanthropy as well as a drug for its treatment." -- i don't believe that this really belongs here, as this is certainly not a typical nor a traditional hallucinogen experience. --thoric (talk) 18:32, 24 october 2018 (utc)
