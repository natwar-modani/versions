a howitzer is a type of artillery, either self-propelled or towable.  the smallest howitzers can be towed by a utility vehicle such as a hummer; most are towed by five-ton or larger trucks.  they are used to fire explosive shells at ground targets up to about 10-15 kilometres away.  modern howitzers fire 105 or 155 millimetre diameter shells at a maximum rate of approximately 10 per minute.  

an example of a towed howitzer is the us marine corps's m198 155mm medium howitzer.
