hellas verona football club s.p.a is an italian football club, based in verona. the team is nicknamed the gialloblu. it currently plays in serie b; their last stint in serie a ended in 2002. the team's colors are yellow and blue.

founded in 1903 by a group of university students, the club was named hellas (the greek word for greece), at the request of a professor of classics. 

from 1898 to 1926 italian soccer was organised into regional groups. in this period hellas was one of the founding teams of the early league and oftentimes among its top final contenders. between 1926 and 1929 the elite "campionato nazionale" replaced the various regional groups and hellas joined the priviledged teams, yet struggled to remain competitive. 

serie a, as it is structured today, began in 1929 when the campionato nazionale turned into a professional league. still an amateur team, hellas merged with two city rivals, bentegodi and scaligera, to form ac verona. hoping to build a first class contender for future years the new team debuted in serie b in 1929. it would take the gialloblu` 28 years to finally achieve their goal. after first being promoted to serie a for one season in 1957-58 in 1959 the team became hellas verona a.c. 

the team returned to serie a in 1968 and remained in the elite league until 1990. along the way it scored a famous 5-3 win on ac milan on the last matchday of the 1972-73 season in a shocker that stopped the rossoneri from clinching a certain scudetto (the serie a title). in the 1983-84 season the team played in its first coppa italia final against defending serie a champions as roma, losing the cup only in the final minutes of the return match. hellas verona ac is certainly most famous for going on to win the scudetto in the following season 1984-85 and for its regular presence in european club soccer in the mid 1980s. 

in 1986 hellas verona ac were eliminated from champions league play by fellow serie a side juventus (winners of the previous edition against liverpool) and in 1988 the team had its best uefa cup result when it reached the quarter-finals. these were more than mere modest achievements for a mid-size city with a limited appeal to fans across the nation. soon enough financial difficulties caught up with team managers. in 1991 the team folded and was reborn as hellas verona f.c., regularly moving to and fro between serie a and serie b ever since.

hellas verona plays in the marcantonio bentegodi stadium, which it shares with crosstown rivals chievo verona. inaugurated as a state-of-the-art facility and as one of italy's finest stadiums in 1963 the stadium appeared excessive for a team that had spent the best part of the last 35 years in serie b. the original capacity of 40'000 spectators was extended to 45'000 in 1990 for the italia '90 world cup, making it italy's 9th largest stadium. renovations included a roof to cover all sections and improved visibility, public transport connections and facilities.
