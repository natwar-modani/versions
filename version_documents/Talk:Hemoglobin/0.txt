paragraph four wants attention: it's a pointless distinction between "broken down" and "broken up." but the paragraph makes it sound as if the hemoglobin and a red blood cell are always recycled at the same time. so it would seem that each red blood cell has a certain amount of hemoglobin that stays with it for the duration of that cell's life? is that the case? (interesting, but not as cute as monogamous ducks.) :-d

point taken. i hope it's a bit clearer now. on your other point, human red blood cells i believe are pretty much stuck with their initial load of hemoglobin. mammalian red blood cells don't have cell nuclei, so they can't be doing much de novo synthesis of any protein. reptile blood cells do have nuclei (or jurassic park would have lost its major plot premise), so they might do synthesis. i'm not a herpetologist so i don't know.
