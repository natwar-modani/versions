heckler und koch gmbh (h&k) is a german weapons manufacturing company famous for various series of small firearms, notably the mp5 submachine gun and the g3 assault rifle. it has recently been contracted by the us military to produce the objective individual combat weapon, a planned replacement for the m-16/m203 grenade launcher combination which will fire both 5.56mm and 20mm cannon ammunition.

h&k was founded by edmund heckler and theodor koch in 1949, and the company was registered in 1950. in the beginning, the company produced sewing machines and other fine mechanics, but this was changed in 1956 when the company constructed a rifle for the german bundeswehr. in 1991, h&k was bought by british aerospace (now bae systems).

the company is located in oberndorf in the bundesland of baden-w√ºrttemberg, but also has a subsidiary in the united states.
