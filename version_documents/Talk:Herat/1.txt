 majority sunni? 

the article says the city is majority sunni, but it is unsourced. i don't think this information is true. the main population is farsiwans, which can in the end be called "persians" or  "iranians". and they are shia. 2a00:1028:919e:be42:3cab:ca8:fbc7:3917 (talk) 11:54, 5 november 2015 (utc)
