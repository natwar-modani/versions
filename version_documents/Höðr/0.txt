qabbalistic mystics hod

hod is the eighth sephiroth of the qabbalistic tree of life. the meaning of its hebrew name is "splendour", and it is connected to malkuth by path 31, yesod by path 30, tiphareth by path 26 and gevurah by path 23. hod is usually considered by modern magick the "magical sphere", related to the egyptian god thoth, greek hermes and roman mercury. it is related too with the odour of storax.

in a mystical sense, in which the tree of life is supposed to be a roadmap to consciousness, hod is where form is given by language in its widest sense, being the key to the mistery of form.

loki tricks hod into shooting baldur

norse mythology hod

also known as hodur, in norse mythology, hod was the god of darkness and winter, the blind brother of baldur and son of odin and frigg. it was hod who threw the mistletoe spear(arrow)(guided by loki) which was to slay the otherwise invulnerable baldur. because everyone loved baldur so much, frigg made everything in existence swear to love baldur and never to harm him. everything did so, except for the mistletoe. frigg did not think that this was significant, so did not ask the mistletoe to accept the oath. the gods amused themselves by hurling things at baldur, these things would always veer off and never strike true (because they had sworn never to harm baldur). loki, upon finding out about baldur's one weakness, made a spear(or arrow) from mistletoe, and helped hodur throw(fire) it at baldur. for this crime, odin and frigg gave birth to vali specifically so he could kill hod.

note: another version says that odin and frigg knew that loki was responsible for baldur's death, and that vali's task was to take vengence for baldur upon loki.
