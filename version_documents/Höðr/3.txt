in norse mythology, hod (also hodur, on hǫðr''), was the god of darkness and winter, the blind brother of baldur and son of odin and frigg. it was hod who threw the mistletoe spear(arrow)(guided by loki) which was to slay the otherwise invulnerable baldur. because everyone loved baldur so much, frigg made everything in existence swear to love baldur and never to harm him. everything did so, except for the mistletoe. frigg did not think that this was significant, so did not ask the mistletoe to accept the oath. the gods amused themselves by hurling things at baldur, these things would always veer off and never strike true (because they had sworn never to harm baldur). loki, upon finding out about baldur's one weakness, made a spear(or arrow) from mistletoe, and helped hodur throw(fire) it at baldur. for this crime, odin and rind, a giantess, gave birth to vali specifically so he could kill hod.

note: another version says that odin and frigg knew that loki was responsible for baldur's death, and that vali's task was to take vengence for baldur upon loki.
