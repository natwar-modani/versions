overdosing risks
the presence of acetaminophen in hydrocodone-containing products deters many drug users from taking excessive amounts. however, some users will get around this by extracting a portion of the acetaminophen using hot/cold water, taking advantage of the water-soluble element of the drug. it is not uncommon for addicts to have liver problems from consuming excessive amounts of acetaminophen over a long period of time; taking 10 to 15 grams of acetaminophen in a period of 24 hours typically results in severe hepatotoxicity, and doses exceding 15 grams a day have been reported as fatal. it is this factor that leads many addicts to use only single entity opiates such as oxycontin. 

daily consumption of hydrocodone should not excede 40 milligrams.   symptoms of hydrocodone overdosage include respiratory depression, extreme somnolence, coma, stupor, cold and/or clammy skin, sometimes bradycardia, and hypotension. a severe overdose may involve circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and/or death.

hydrocodone addictions are most commonly found in contact sports, such as american football, rugby, boxing and wrestling.

alcohol
it is not recommended to mix any amount of hydrocodone with any amount of alcohol as doing so could cause health problems.  however this does not stop people from mixing them due to the feeling of euphoria it provides.
