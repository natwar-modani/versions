hunter college, a senior college of the city university of new york, descends from the normal college for women, organized in new york city in 1870. founded by irish immigrant thomas hunter, it was originally an all-female school for training teachers and incorporated an elementary and high school for gifted children, where hunter college students practiced teaching. in 1887, a kindergarten was established as well. (today, the elementary school and high school still exist, at a different location, and are now called the hunter campus schools.) 

hunter became the women's college of the municipal system, and in the 1950s, when city college became coeducational, started admitting men to its bronx campus. in 1964, the manhattan campus began admitting men also.

the bronx campus subsequently became lehman college in 1968.
