hedeby (referred to also as haithabu) was a settlement and trading center on the southern baltic sea coast of the jutland peninsula at the head of a narrow, navigable fjord, the slie, in what is now southern denmark. the name means "the town on the heath". it was surrounded on all land sides by an earthwork. 

it became a principal market because of its geographical location on the major trade routes between germany and scandinavia, and between the baltic and the north sea. between 800 and 1000 the growing economic power of the vikings who held it at this time led to its dramatic expansion as a major trading center. 

the town was sacked in 1050 by king harold hardrada of norway during the course of a conflict with king sweyn ii of denmark: a norwegian skald, himself quoted by snorri sturlusson, describes the sack as follows: 
burnt in anger from  end to end was hedeby [..]
high rose the flames from the houses when, before dawn, i stood upon the stronghold's arm
