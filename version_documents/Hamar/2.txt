history
between year 500 and 1000, the farm aker was probably one of the most important power centres in norway, located just a few kilometres outside today's hamar. after the christening of norway in year 1030, hamar began to gain influence as a centre for trade and religion, until the episcopal representative nikolaus breakspear in 1152 founded hamar kaupangen as one of five dioceses in medieval norway. it remained an important religious and political centre in norway, organized around the cathedral and the bishop's manor until the reformation in 1536, when it lost its status as a bishopric. the cathedral and manor were destroyed in the northern seven years' war with sweden in 1567, and in 1568 the market was disbanded, under pressure from citizens of oslo. since then, hamar kaupangen gradually lost importance. the site of the medieval city fell into disrepair and was taken over by a farm.

the modern city

the modern city of hamar was founded a kilometer or so south of the old medieval city in 1849 by king oscar as a trading center.
