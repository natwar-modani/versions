hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) is a viscous liquid that has strong oxidizing properties and is therefore a powerful bleaching agent that has found use as a disinfectant and (in strong concentrations) as an oxidant in rocket fuels.

it is commonly used to bleach human hair, hence the phrases "peroxide blonde" and "bottle blonde". it burns if it comes into contact with the skin in sufficient concentration. over time, hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen gas. containers for hydrogen peroxide, therefore, must permit oxygen gas to escape, lest it build up and eventually cause an explosion. the use of a catalyst (such as manganese dioxide or the enzyme catalase) vastly increases the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.

hydrogen peroxide has also been used as a fuel for propulsion. its use in torpedoes has been discontinued by most navies due to safety considerations.  a hydrogen peroxide leak was blamed for the sinkings of hms sidon and the russian submarine kursk.
