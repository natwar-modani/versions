a harmonica is a free reed musical wind instrument (also
known, among other things, as a mouth organ, french harp or
"mississippi saxophone"), having multiple, variably-tuned brass
or bronze reeds, each secured at one end over an airway slot of like
dimension into which it can freely vibrate, thus repeatedly
interrupting an airstream to produce sound.  

unlike most free-reed instruments (e.g., reed organs, accordions
and melodicas), the mouth harmonica lacks a keyboard. instead,
lips and tongue are used to select one or a few of the several holes
arranged usually linearly on a mouthpiece.  each hole communicates
with but one, two or a few reeds.  because a reed mounted above slot
is made to vibrate more easily by air from above, reeds accessed by a
mouthpiece hole often may be selected further by choice of breath
direction (blowing, drawing).

some harmonicas also include a button-actuated slide that, when
depressed, further redirects the air.

the harmonica is commonly used in blues and folk music, but
also in jazz, classical music, country music, rock and roll and pop music.

see pan pipes.

 parts of the harmonica

the harmonica consists of a "comb" made of wood or plastic which
creates the holes into which a player blows or draws to make distinct
tones.  the metallic blow and draw reedplates are screwed onto either side of the comb.  over the reedplates, there is a metal or plastic cover which projects the sound out of the open back.  chromatic harmonicas also have a button-activated slide.

 harmonica types 

 the diatonic harmonica 

the diatonic harmonica is most likely what you think of when you think
of a "harmonica."  it has ten holes which offer the player 19 notes
(10 holes times a draw and a blow for each hole minus one repeated
note) in a three octave range. the standard diatonic harmonica is
designed to allow a player to play chords and melody in a single key.
because they are only designed to be played in a single key at a time,
diatonic harmonicas are available in all keys.  here is a standard
diatonic harmonica's layout in the key of c (4 blow is middle c):

        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 
        ----------------------------- 
 blow: |c |e |g |c |e |g |c |e |g |c | 
 draw: |d |g |b |d |f |a |b |d |f |a | 
        -----------------------------

note that although there are 3 octaves between 1 and 10 blow, there is only one full major scale available on the harmonica, between holes 4 and 7.  the lower holes are designed around the tonic (c major) and dominant (g major) chords, allowing a player to play these chords underneath a melody by blocking or unblocking the lower holes with the tongue.

in addition to the 19 notes readily available on the harmonica,
players can play other notes by adjusting their embouchure and forcing
the reed to resonate at a different pitch.  this technique is
called "bending", a term borrowed from guitarists, who literally "bend" a string in order to create subtle changes in pitch. using bending, a player can reach all the notes on the
major scale. "bending" also creates the glissandos
characteristic of much blues and country harmonica playing.  

the physics of bending are quite complex, but amount to this: a player can
bend the pitch of the higher-tuned reed down toward the pitch of the lower-tuned reed in any given hole.  in other words, on holes 1 through 6, the draw notes can be bent and on holes 7 through 10 the blow notes can be bent. hole 3 allows for the most dramatic bending: in c, it is possible to bend 3 draw from a b down to a g#, or anywhere in between.

howard levy developed another technique in the 1970s that allows players
to force a reed to vibrate faster, resulting in a higher pitch.  this
technique is called overblowing or overdrawing and is much
less frequently used.  for the few who master this technique, the
diatonic harmonica can  function as a fully chromatic instrument.

special tuned harmonicas

the hohner marine band 1896 14 hole harmonica is not a standard diatonic harmonica. it has 14 holes and its general dimensions are a bit bigger, so its structure is different from the normal diatonic harmonica and it is pitched one octave lower than the standard 10 hole diatonic.  thus, hole 4 blow is one octave below middle c.  hole 7 blow is middle c.  holes 1 through 4 and 6 are draw bendable, and holes 8 through 14 are blow bendable.

        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 
        ------------------------------------------ 
 blow: |c |e |g |c |e |g |c |e |g |c |e |g |c |e |
 draw: |d |g |b |d |f |a |b |d |f |a |b |d |f |a | 
        ------------------------------------------

 the chromatic harmonica 

the chromatic harmonica has a button-operated slide that allows the
player to change the pitch of any given hole.  this means that each
hole has 4 pitches rather than 2.  the slide typically shifts the
pitch of any given note by a half step.  the note layout on a
chromatic is traditionally the same as the note layout on holes 4-7 of
the diatonic harmonica, and is repeated over its length.  chromatic
harmonicas are usually 12 or 16 holes long.

because it is a fully chromatic instrument, the chromatic harmonica is
the instrument of choice in jazz and classical music.  in traditional
harmonica bands, the chromatic harmonica plays the lead part.

        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 
        ------------------------------ 
 blow: |c |e |g |c |c |e |g |c |e |g |  key out
 draw: |d |f |a |b |d |f |a |b |d |f | 
        ------------------------------

        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 
        ------------------------------ 
 blow: |c#|e#|g#|c#|c#|e#|g#|c#|e#|g#|  key in
 draw: |d#|f#|a#|b#|d#|f#|a#|b#|d#|f#| 
        ------------------------------
note that there is no b# so it is a c.  neither is there a e# which is an f.

 the bass harmonica 

the bass harmonica is a special harmonica mostly used in ensemble playing. it usually consists of two harmonicas held together, one above the other, by an adjustable bracket. the lower harmonica has the natural notes of the chromatic scale, while the upper harmonica has the accidental notes.
the bass harmonica has only blow notes.

 the chord harmonica 
the chord harmonica has two reeds for each note, tuned to one octave of each other. this gives the harmonica a more powerful and rich sound.

 the tremolo harmonica 

tremolo harmonicas have two reeds per hole. the two reeds are tuned to be slightly out of tune relative to each other. this produces a tremolo effect.

 the octave harmonica 

octave harmonicas have two reeds per hole.  the two reeds are tuned to the same note a perfect octave apart.

 history and related instruments 

the unrelated glass harmonica is a musical instrument formed of a nested set of graduated glass cups mounted sideways on an axle and partially immersed in water, and played by touching the rotating cups with wetted fingers, causing them to vibrate.

 harmonica community 

there is an active harmonica community on the internet and in real
life, with conferences, cruises and everything.  spah (society for the
preservation and advancement of the harmonica) is one society with a
particularly amusing acronym.  a harmonica list-serv is hosted at
this web site with searchable archives.
