a harmonica is a free-reed musical wind instrument (also known among other things as a mouth organ, french harp or "mississippi saxophone"), having multiple, variably-tuned brass or bronze reeds, each secured at one end over an airway slot of like dimension into which it can freely vibrate, thus repeatedly interrupting an airstream to produce sound; and 

unlike most free-reed instruments (e.g., reed organs, accordions and melodicas), the mouth harmonica lacks a keyboard. instead, lips and tongue are used to select one or a few of the several holes arranged usually linearly on a mouthpiece.  each hole communicates with but one, two or a few reeds.  because a reed mounted above slot is made to vibrate more easily by air from above, reeds accessed by a mouthpiece hole often may be selected further by choice of breath direction (blowing, drawing).  

some harmonicas also include a button-actuated slide that, when depressed, further redirects the air. 

the harmonica is commonly used in blues and folk music, but also in jazz and rock and roll and pop music.

the unrelated glass harmonica is a musical instrument formed of a nested set of graduated glass cups mounted sideways on an axle and partially immersed in water, and played by touching the rotating cups with wetted fingers, causing them to vibrate.
