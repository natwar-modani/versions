hawick (pronounced "hoick") is a town in the unitary council region of scottish borders in the south of scotland. it is most well-known for its annual common riding, which also commemorates a victory of local youths over an english raiding party in 1514, and which women were only recently allowed to ride in once more. it is one of the furthest towns from the sea in scotland, in the heart of teviotdale and the largest town in the former county of roxburghshire. it is also known for quality knitwear production and as the home of hawick rfc.

people from hawick call themselves "teri"s, after a traditional song which includes the line "teribus y teriodin", which may refer to anglo saxon gods.
more recently, the definition of "teri" may be described as someone who has lived in hawick as soon as it was possible, as all children of hawick parents after july 1988 will have been born in the borders general hospital in melrose.

hawick lies in the valley of the teviot at the point the river slitrig joins it. the a7 edinburgh to carlisle road passes through the town, with main roads also leading to kelso and newcastle.
the town lost its rail service in 1969, but there is a regular bus service to the railway station at carlisle, 50 miles away. the nearest airports are at edinburgh and newcastle.

rivalry between the small border towns is generally played out on the rugby field but the oft-comical historical antagonism has lessened in recent years as the economic fortunes of the region have declined.

the hawick ba game was played here by the 'uppies' and the 'doonies' on the first monday after the new moon in the month of february. the river of the town formed an important part of the pitch.
