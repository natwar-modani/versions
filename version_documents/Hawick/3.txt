hawick (pronounced "haw-eek") is a town in the scottish borders in the south east of scotland. it is most well-known for its annual common riding, which also commemorates a victory of local youths over an english raiding party in 1514.

it is one of the furthest towns from the sea in scotland, in the heart of teviotdale and the largest town in the former county of roxburghshire. it is also known for quality knitwear production and as the home of hawick rugby football club, one of the world's oldest and most famous sides.

people from hawick call themselves "teri"s, after a traditional song which includes the line "teribus y teriodin", which may refer to anglo saxon gods.

hawick lies in the valley of the teviot at the point the river slitrig joins it. the a7 edinburgh to carlisle road passes through the town, with main roads also leading to kelso and newcastle.
the town lost its rail service in 1969, but there is a regular bus service to the railway station at carlisle, 50 miles away. the nearest airports are at edinburgh and newcastle.

rivalry between the small border towns is generally played out on the rugby field and the comical historical antagonism continues to this day, hawick's main rival being the similarly-sized town of galashiels.

ba game 
the long forgotten hawick ba game was played here by the 'uppies' and the 'doonies' on the first monday after the new moon in the month of february. the river of the town formed an important part of the pitch. although the ba game is no longer played at hawick, it is still played at nearby jedburgh.
