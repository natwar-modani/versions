in united states law, a hostile witness is a witness in a trial who testifies for the opposing party or a witness who offers adverse testimony to the calling party during direct examination.

a witness called by the opposing party is presumed hostile.  a witness called by the direct examiner can be declared hostile by a judge, at the request of the examiner, when the witness' testimony is openly antagonistic or clearly prejudiced to the opposing party.

a party examining a hostile witness may question the witness as if in cross-examination, thus permitting the use of leading questions. a hostile witness is sometimes known as an adverse witness.
