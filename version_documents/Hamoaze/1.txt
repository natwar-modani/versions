the hamoaze (ipa:  in cornish) is an estuarine stretch of water at the point where the tidal river tamar, the river tavy, and the river lynher enter plymouth sound.

the hamoaze flows past devonport dockyard, which belongs to the royal navy, and the presence of naval ships presents particular hazards to small watercraft.
