"davy became known due to his experiences with the physiological action of some gases." --do you mean experiments with?  --koyaanis qatsi
davy had his friends over to do the experiments with them. they were under the influence.

i went googling and i can safely say i've never seen a name incorrectly spelled so often in my life. well, except edmund-edmond halley, but that was because halley spelled it both ways. the definitive sources all gow with humphry-no-e, though. good eyes. -- paul drye

"davy became well known owing to his experiences with the physiological action of some gases" what is that supposed to say? --floog

sorry, didn't bother reading above, fixed what it said on the actual page.--floog

i went to the humphry (without an 'e') davy (without an 'e') grammar (without and 'e') school so i don't usually make the 'humphrey' mistake. i will try and get a nice picture of his statue when i am next down at penzance in a few weeks.chrisangove 22:06, 17 may 2006 (utc)

is anyone interested in inserting the e.c. bentley clerihew regarding davy into the text? it reads;
sir humphry davy,
detested gravy.
he lived on the odium
of discovering sodium
obviously, the gravy comment will need researching.lessheard vanu 23:19, 8 july 2006 (utc)
