hatfield, originally bishop's hatfield, is a town in the welwyn hatfield district of hertfordshire, in the south of england. it forms part of the welwyn hatfield constituency which also includes welwyn garden city, and has been twinned with the dutch port town of zierikzee since 1953. its mp is grant shapps (con.). it is known as the town where the first production-line jet airliner, the de havilland comet was built, and as the site of a tragic rail crash in 2000.
