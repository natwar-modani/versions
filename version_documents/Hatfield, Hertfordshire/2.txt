hatfield, originally bishop's hatfield, is a town in the welwyn hatfield district of hertfordshire, in the south of england. it forms part of the welwyn hatfield constituency which also includes welwyn garden city, and has been twinned with the dutch port town of zierikzee since 1953. its mp is grant shapps (con.).

 modern development 
the town is the site of the original campus of hatfield polytechnic, which has since become the university of hertfordshire.   it is also the location of the first de havilland aircraft factory with an associated airfield where airliners such as the dove, heron, comet, trident and hs146 were built. production of the latter type was transferred to woodford in cheshire during the 1990s by which time it was known as the british aerospace 146 "whisperjet". an early bizjet, the dh125, was also developed here although mass production took place at hawarden in cheshire. some components of wind turbines were also developed here prior to the airfield's closure. 

until the early 1990s british aerospace maintained a substantial presence within the town. their vacated premises and surrounding grounds served as a film set for some of the night-time scenes of the bbc/hbo television drama band of brothers, which followed on from significant use of the site in the filming of the steven spielberg movie saving private ryan. subsequently, a large section of the land was purchased by the university of hertfordshire and the £120 million de havilland campus, incorperating a £15 million sports village, was opened in september 2003. the university has closed its sites at watford and hertford, and faculties situated there have been relocated to the de havilland campus. the university maintains its campus at st albans, which houses law students.

in addition to the new university campus, part of the former bae land will also be the site of a £500 million new hospital to replace the queen elizabeth ii hospital in welwyn. the university is looking to expand its nursing and physiotherapy departments to accommodate and utilise the extra facilities available to it. redevelopment of hatfield town centre is also planned for 2005, when a large part of the northern end of the town centre will be demolished and replaced with improved shopping facilities and public amenities.

the area contains the site of a fatal rail crash on october 17, 2000. the incident brought track maintenance deficiencies to public attention, to the severe detriment of railtrack, the company established to manage rail infrastructure, and set in motion the events that led to its insolvency. it is five miles north of potters bar, scene of a later fatal train derailment.
