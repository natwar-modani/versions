the hawaiian god kane is considered to be the procreator and the provider of life.  he is associated with wai (fresh water) as well as clouds, rain, streams and springs. kanaloa, the hawaiian god of the underworld, is represented by the phallic stone of the ī'ao needle.  

during the late 15th century, ī‘ao  valley was designated as an ali‘i burial area by kaka‘e, the ruler of maui and o‘ahu.  the remains of the chiefs were buried in secret hiding places in the valley.  in 1790 the valley was the site of the battle of kepaniwai.  it was the battle in which kamehameha the great  defeated king kalanikupule and conquered the maui army in order to unify the islands.  the battle was said to be so bloody that dead bodies blocked the iao stream, and in turn, the battle site was named kepaniwai ("damming of the waters").
