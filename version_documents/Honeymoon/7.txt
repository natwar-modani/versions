a honeymoon is the traditional holiday taken by newlyweds to celebrate their marriage in intimacy and seclusion. today, honeymoons by westerners are celebrated somewhere exotic or otherwise considered romantic. 

history of honeymoon
originally "honeymoon" simply described the period just after the wedding when things are at their sweetest; it is assumed to wane in a month. this is the period when newly wed couples take a break to share some private and intimate moments that helps establish love in relationship. this privacy in turn is believed to ease the comfort zone towards physical relationship, which is one of the primary means of bonding during the initial days of marriage. the earliest term for this in english was hony moone, which was recorded as early as 1546.

in western culture, the custom of a newlywed couple going on a holiday together originated in early 19th century great britain, a concept borrowed from the indian elite in the indian subcontinent. upper-class couples would take a "bridal tour", sometimes accompanied by friends or family, to visit relatives who had not been able to attend the wedding. the practice soon spread to the european continent and was known as voyage à la façon anglaise (english-style voyage) in france from the 1820s on.

honeymoons in the modern sense (i.e. a pure holiday voyage undertaken by the married couple) became widespread during the belle époque, as one of the first instances of modern mass tourism. this came about in spite of initial disapproval by contemporary medical opinion (which worried about women's frail health) and by savoir vivre guidebooks (which referred the public attention drawn to what was assumed to be the wife's sexual initiation). the most popular honeymoon destinations at the time were the french riviera and italy, particularly its seaside resorts and romantic cities such as rome, verona or venice. typically honeymoons would start on the night they were married, with the couple leaving midway through the reception to catch a late train or ship.  however, in the 21st century, many couples will not leave until 1–3 days after the ceremony and reception in order to tie up loose ends with the reception venue and/or simply enjoy the reception to its fullest and have a relaxing night afterwards to recover, before undertaking a long journey.

etymology

the oxford english dictionary offers no etymology, but gives examples dating back to the 16th century. the merriam-webster dictionary reports the etymology as from "the idea that it is the first opportunity for a man to see his wife's bottom" (1546).

a honeymoon can also be the first moments a newly-wed couple spend together, or the first holiday they spend together to celebrate their marriage.

one of the more recent citations in the oxford english dictionary indicates that, while today honeymoon has a positive meaning, the word was originally a reference to the inevitable waning of love like a phase of the moon. this, the first known literary reference to the honeymoon, was penned in 1552, in richard huloet's abecedarium anglico latinum. huloet writes:

an alternate etymology states that the word "honeymoon" derived from a traditional european practice of supplying a newly married couple with enough mead for a month, ensuring happiness and fertility. given that this etymology does not appear in the usual scholarly works on etymology, this claim is usually dismissed as a false etymology.  

there are many calques of the word honeymoon from english into other languages.  the french form translates as "moon of honey" (lune de miel), as do the spanish (luna de miel), portuguese (lua de mel) and italian (luna di miele)  equivalents.  the welsh word for honeymoon is mis mêl, which translates as "honey month", and similarly the ukrainian (медовий місяць), polish (miesiąc miodowy), russian (медовый месяц), arabic (شهر العسل shahr el 'assal), greek (μήνας του μέλιτος) and hebrew (ירח דבש yerach d'vash) versions. (interestingly, yerach is used for month, rather than the more common chodesh.  yerach is related to the word yare'ach for moon and the two words are spelled alike: ירח.) the persian word is ماه عسل māh-e asal which means both "honey moon" and "honey month" (māh in persian means both moon and month). the same applies to the word ay in the turkish equivalent, balayı. in hungarian language it is called "honey weeks" (mézeshetek). likewise, the tamil word for honeymoon is தேனிலவு (thaen nilavu), with thaen 'honey' and nilavu 'moon', and the marathi word for honeymoon is मधुचंद्र (madhuchandra) with madhu 'honey' and chandra 'moon', whereas in bangla ('bengali') language, it is referred to as মধুচনাদরিমা (modhuchondrima) with modhu 'honey and chondrima'' 'moon'.
