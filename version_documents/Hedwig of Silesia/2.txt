one of hedwig's sisters married king andrew ii of hungary. their daughter was saint elisabeth of hungary, also known as elizabeth of thuringia. another of hedwig's sisters was abbess at the benedictine convent of lutzingen in franconia, where hedwig received her education.

at age 12, hedwig married henry i the bearded of silesia. in 1233 henry also became duke of greater poland. 

in 1238, upon his death, henry was buried at the cistercian convent of trebnitz (trzebnica) which he had founded in 1202 on the request of hedwig. the widow moved into the convent which was led by one of her daughters. on 15 october 1243, she died and was buried there, while relics of her are preserved at andechs abbey.

hedwig and henry had a son, henry ii the pious who in 1241 was killed by the mongols in the battle of legnica. 

hedwig and henry had lived a very pious life, and hedwig had great zeal for religion. she always helped the poor, went barefoot even in winter, and donated all her fortune to the church and the poor. hedwig was canonized in 1267.

in 1773 frederick the great, king of prussia, built the st. hedwig's cathedral in berlin, now the mother church of the archdiocese of berlin, for the roman catholic immigrants from silesia. as silesians (and other germans) were expelled from their homes after world war ii, silesian expellees regard hedwig as their patron saint.

hedwig is also the patron saint of brandenburg, of berlin, of silesia (schlesien) and its capital wrocław (breslau), of trzebnica (trebnitz), the diocese of görlitz (being cut from erzbistum breslau after 1945), of andechs abbey and of cracow. st. hedwig's cathedral  of berlin.
