london has a history that goes back more than 2000 years. during this time it has experienced plague, devastating fire, civil war, overwhelming aerial bombardment, terrorist attacks, and has still grown from a collection of riverside fishing villages to become one of the mercantile capitals of the western world.

london predates the roman occupation of britain as the town of lud. the occupying romans quickly saw the military significance of its geographical location and established it as their headquarters, naming it londinium in approximately 43 ad.

twenty years later, the celtic chieftainess boudicca, leading the iceni, sacked londoninium (c. 60 ad).

in 1666, the great fire of london destroyed much of the city.  much of the rebuilding (including saint pauls cathedral) was done by sir christopher wren.

during world war ii london, as well as many other british cities, suffered extensive damage, being bombed extensively by the luftwaffe as a part of the blitz.
