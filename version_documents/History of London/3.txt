london has a history that goes back more than 2,000 years. during this time, it has experienced plague, devastating fire, civil war, overwhelming aerial bombardment, and terrorist attacks, yet, it has still grown from a collection of riverside fishing villages to become one of the mercantile capitals of the western world.

in medieval mythology, london predated the roman occupation of britain as the town of lud, but while there was prehistoric settlement along the thames in the london basin, it was not until the roman invasion in 43 ad that a permanent settlement was created. the occupying romans quickly saw the military significance of its geographical location and established it as their headquarters, naming it londinium. in order to defend the town, they built a large fort, called cripple gate fort, to house the troops and a large wall (london wall) along the perimeter of the town.

twenty years later, the celtic queen boudicca, leading the
iceni, sacked (plundered) londinium (c. 60 ad).  when the romans left britain, london entered a period of decline, and the saxon settlements in the area were not in the ancient walled city of london, but to the west in what is today the strand.

london remained an important town, though, and the walled area was resettled due to vikings.  the normans constructed several forts, including the tower of london to prevent rebellions.  the nearby up-river town of westminster became the royal capital, and the area between them entirely urbanised by 1600.

in 1666, the great fire of london destroyed much of the city.  most of the rebuilding (including st. paul's cathedral) was done by sir christopher wren.

the urbanised area continued to grow rapidly, spreading into islington, paddington, belgravia, holborn, finsbury, shoreditch, southwark and lambeth.   this process was increased by the railways and the policies of slum clearances.  in 1855 the metropolitan board of works was set up with responsibility for transport and other projects - and a london county council was set up in 1888 with authority for the inner area of the urbanised region.

during world war ii, london, as many other british cities, suffered severe damage, being bombed extensively by the luftwaffe as a part of the blitz. london was a popular target with the luftwaffe was the city was heavily industrialized. many children in london were taken to the countryside so they would not get killed in bombing.

the outward expansion of london was slowed by the war, and the green belt established soon afterwards.  greater london council was set up in 1965 with authority for much more of the urban area. the london commuter belt covers an area much wider, but is not considered part of london.
