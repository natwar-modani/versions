hate speech is a general term used to describe the use of language in a manner intended to incite hatred or contempt towards some group of people, typically an ethnic group or sexual minority.
it may also denote any idea held to be hateful or contemptuous in effect, regardless of its original intent. in this wider sense, it may serve to suppress views deemed unfavorable to a person or group.

some american universities have speech codes that prohibit hate speech. these rules are intended to ensure an atmosphere free from harassment and intimidation, conducive to a learning environment. many speakers have opposed such speech codes, claiming they constitute a new orthodoxy of political correctness and represent an erosion of the freedom of speech guaranteed in the first amendment to the united states constitution, which strictly speaking only prohibits government censorship.  freedom of speech, however, is a widely held value beyond the governmental sphere and many universities are government institutions and almost all accept government funds.    

some observers believe that the accusation of hate speech is often made to suppress points of view which are unfavorable to certain "protected groups", which represents a significant infringement of the tradition of academic freedom and gives members of these groups an unfair advantage in the marketplace of ideas.

for example, for a college professor to say, "lesbians should not be schoolteachers", could be considered hate speech. the professor could be denied tenure, even if he were expressing his religious belief that people who engage in lesbian behavior should not be put in positions where they can influence young people. the defense that he doesn't hate lesbians and didn't intend to hurt anyone's feelings would be dismissed on the grounds that to object to certain behavior or have one's livelihood threatened is harmful on its face.
