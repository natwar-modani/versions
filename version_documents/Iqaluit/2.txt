iqaluit (ᐃᖃᓗᐃᑦ in inuktitut syllabics), formerly frobisher bay, is the territorial capital and the largest community of canada's youngest territory, nunavut. its population is about 60% inuit, a lower figure than in other parts of nunavut. the town was selected to serve as the new territory's capital in a territory-wide referendum, in which it was chosen over rankin inlet and cambridge bay. 

the city is located in the hills rising from koojesse inlet, an inlet of frobisher bay, on the south-east part of baffin island.  it is well to the east of nunavut's mainland, and northeast of hudson bay. inhabitants of iqaluit are called iqalummiut (singular: iqalummiuq). 

iqaluit has the distinction of being the smallest canadian capital city in terms of population and the only capital that cannot be accessed from the rest of canada via a highway.

according to the 2001 census, iqaluit has a population of 5,236.

history

begun in 1942 as an american airbase, iqaluit's first permanent inhabitant was nakasuk, an inuk guide who helped american planners to choose the site.  one of the city's elementary schools is named after him.  long regarded as a campsite and fishing spot by the inuit, the place chosen had traditionally been named iqaluit - "many fish" in inuktitut - but canadian and american authorities baptised it frobisher bay, after the official name of the body of water it abuts.  

the hudson bay company moved its south baffin operations to the neighbouring valley of niaqunngut, officially called apex, in 1949 to take advantage of the airfield.  the population of frobisher bay increased rapidly during the construction of the distant early warning line (dew line, a system of radar stations, see norad) in the mid-1950s.  hundreds of construction workers, military personnel and administrative staff moved into the community, and several hundred inuit followed to take advantage of the access to medical care and jobs the base provided.  of the town's 1,200 residents, 489 were reported to be inuit in 1957.  after 1959, the canadian government established permanent services at frobisher bay, including full-time doctors, a school and social services.  the inuit population grew rapidly in response, as the government encouraged inuit to settle permanently in communities with government services.

the american military left iqaluit in 1963, as icbms diminished the strategic value of the dew line and arctic airbases, but frobisher bay remained the government's administrative and logistical centre for much of the eastern arctic.  1964 saw the election of the first elected community council, and 1979 the first mayor. the founding of the gordon robertson educational centre (now inukshuk high school) in the early-1970s at iqaluit confirmed the government's commitment to the community as an administrative centre.  at the time of its founding, it was the sole high school operating in more than a seventh of canadian territory.

on january 1, 1987, the name of this municipality was officially changed from "frobisher bay" to "iqaluit" - aligning official usage with the name that the inuit population had always used.  in december 1995, it was selected in a referendum to be the future capital of nunavut and on april 19, 2001 it was officially recognised as a city.

transportation
frame|left|iqaluit airport, taken in september 2005
located on an island remote from the canadian highway system, iqaluit is generally only accessible by aircraft and, subject to ice conditions, by boat. iqaluit airport is a fully modern facility whose originally wwii-era runway is more than long enough for most classes of modern jet.  although there is a persistent rumour that iqaluit is an emergency landing site for the space shuttle, this is false.
 
in the middle of summer, a few ships - generally no larger than a liberty class vessel - transport bulk and heavy goods to the city.  iqaluit does not have a deep water harbour, so goods must be barged ashore, or the ship may be beached at high tide and the goods unloaded when the tide goes out.

it is in principle possible to reach iqaluit on foot or by dog sled or snowmobile, both from other parts of baffin island and from the quebec mainland when hudson strait freezes.  this was how the inuit traditionally travelled, and how they still do sometimes, but it is ill-advised for anyone who is not experienced in arctic travel.

iqaluit has a local road system encompassing the nearby community of apex and the sylvia grenell territorial park reserve a kilometre away.  iqaluit operates a two-line bus system that extends as far apex, and there is city-wide taxi service.  although a growing number of people have personal automobiles, the cost of shipping them and the wear-and-tear of the harsh arctic climate and notoriously rough roadways mean that snowmobiles are the preferred form of personal transportation. nevertheless, the ever-increasing number of personal automobiles is beginning to create traffic problems at peak times. all-terrain vehicles are also an increasingly common form of transportation in most of the canadian arctic. snowmobiles and, to a lesser extent, dog sleds are still extensively used to travel in the surrounding area.  in winter, the nearby qaummaarviit territorial historic park and the more remote katannilik territorial park are only accessible by such forms of transportation.  in the summer, both are accessible by boat.

architecture and attractions
much of iqaluit's architecture is functional - designed to minimise material costs, while retaining heat and withstanding the climate.  early architecture runs from the 1950s military barracks of the original dew line installation, through the 1970s white hyper-modernist fibreglass block of the nakasuk elementary school, to the lines of the steel-reinforced concrete high-rise complex on the hill above it.  the newer buildings are more colourful and diverse, and closer to the norms of southern architecture, but largely unremarkable.

the two principal exceptions are st. jude's anglican cathedral and the nunavut legislative assembly building.  st. jude's cathedral is a white building shaped like an igloo.  originally built by the parishioners, the altar is shaped like a traditional inuit sled, and the cross is composed of two crossed narwhal tusks.  the interior of the cathedral was destroyed by fire on 5 november 2005.

the legislative complex is remarkable for its colourful interior, adorned with some of the very best in inuit art.

the city is also the location of the nunatta sunakkutaangit museum, which houses a large collection of inuit and arctic objects.
