i have amended the belgian revolution a bit. you made it sound like the flemings were forced into independence and though pro-french elements were responsible for igniting the revolt, the core sentiments among both flemings and walloons were more as i described imho. -- [[user:scipius]

i added a little known fact about wwi and the german army taking a short cut over a small bit of lands of the netherlands, maybe someone can add to this. -- golf

i always learned in school that there was no actual relation between the old frisians (in roman times), and the later ones? the new frisians took up the name of the region. (the remark about "still do")

i think this section is not exactly accurate.

the history of this small country starts with its first inhabitants, hunters that lived during the last ice age thousands of years ago. notable remains of that period include the monumental hunebeds in the province drenthe.

it makes it seem as if the hunebeds were put up by hunters during the last ice age, 8,000 bce or so. according to a random google they were built between 3400 and 3200 bce. that's  quite a huge distance in time. according to the same source the people who put up these monuments were early farmers. it's like confusing ancient egypt with the reign of charlemaine.. martijn faassen 23:12, 23 nov 2004 (utc)

intro expansion request
i'd like to put this article on the main page, but the introduction could use some beefing up. also, someone else noted that the painting (the nightwatch) seems a bit arbitrary, and that a better painting (perhaps a painting of a historical event described in the article) would be better. â†’raul654 00:56, jan 29, 2005 (utc)
