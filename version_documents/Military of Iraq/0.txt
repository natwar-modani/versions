the iran-iraq war ended with iraq supporting the largest military of the middle east, with more than 70 army divisions and over 700 aircraft within its air force. losses during the invasion of kuwait and the subsequent ejection of iraqi forces from kuwait by a united nations coalition resulted in the reduction of iraq's ground forces to 23 divisions and the air force to less than 300 aircraft. military and economic sanctions prevent iraq from rebuilding its military power, however, iraq still maintains a standing military of over 450,000 troops. 

order of battle of the iraqi army -- january 10 2003

iraq fields at least 59 infantry, 21 mechanized, and 19 armored divisions. in addition, there are 5 brigades composing the special republican guard. 

republican guard (rg)-- 140,000 troops located along the tigris, to the north and south of baghdad
special republican guard (srg) -- 15,000 troops located along the tigris, just south of baghdad
regular army -- 300,000 troops located primarily in eastern iraq 

is the regular army loyal?

former general bernard trainor and colonel jack jacobs, working now for msnbc, argue that the central location of the republican guard troops indicates that the iraqi government does not trust it's regular army. however, this is speculation.
