history
the iran-iraq war ended with iraq supporting the largest military of the middle east, with more than 70 army divisions and over 700 aircraft within its air force. losses during the invasion of kuwait and the subsequent ejection of iraqi forces from kuwait by a united nations coalition resulted in the reduction of iraq's ground forces to 23 divisions and the air force to less than 300 aircraft. military and economic sanctions prevent iraq from rebuilding its military power, however, iraq still maintains a standing military of about 375,000 troops. 

in the 1990s, iraq had an arsenal of chemical and biological weapons. during weapons inspections in 2003, united nations weapons inspectors searched iraqi sites. together with the iraqi government, the un participated in "substantial measures of disarmament," with several weapons of mass destruction being accounted for and destroyed.  in late 2003, an american-led coalition invaded and occupied iraq. few weapons of mass destruction have been found.

was the regular army loyal?
former general bernard trainor and colonel jack jacobs, working now for msnbc, argue that the central location of the republican guard troops indicates that the iraqi government does not trust its regular army. however, this is speculation.
