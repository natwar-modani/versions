the iran-iraq war ended with iraq supporting the largest military of the middle east, with more than 70 army divisions and over 700 aircraft within its air force. losses during the invasion of kuwait and the subsequent ejection of iraqi forces from kuwait by a united nations coalition resulted in the reduction of iraq's ground forces to 23 divisions and the air force to less than 300 aircraft. military and economic sanctions prevent iraq from rebuilding its military power, however, iraq still maintains a standing military of about 375,000 troops. 

iraq once had a large arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, as well as the beginnings of a nuclear weapons program (see weapons of mass destruction,  disarmament of iraq). however, the 2003 invasion of iraq has not yet uncovered any of those weapons, and they are presumed to have been either destroyed, hidden, or exported.  intelligence reports detailing iraq's arsenal were called into question by a national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states.

is the regular army loyal?

former general bernard trainor and colonel jack jacobs, working now for msnbc, argue that the central location of the republican guard troops indicates that the iraqi government does not trust its regular army. however, this is speculation.
