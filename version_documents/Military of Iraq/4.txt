the military of iraq is the armed forces of iraq, consisting of the new iraqi army, the iraqi air force, and the iraqi coastal defense force.  iraq is currently rebuilding its military after the 2003 invasion of iraq.

history
the iran-iraq war ended with iraq supporting the largest military of the middle east, with more than 70 army divisions and over 700 aircraft within its air force. losses during the invasion of kuwait and the subsequent ejection of iraqi forces from kuwait by a united nations coalition resulted in the reduction of iraq's ground forces to 23 divisions and the air force to less than 300 aircraft. military and economic sanctions prevent iraq from rebuilding its military power, however, iraq still maintained a standing military of about 375,000 troops. it was during the late 80's until 1991 the worlds 4th biggest, smaller only than the armed forces of usa, soviet union and china.

in the 1980s and 1990s, iraq had an arsenal of chemical and biological weapons.  during new weapons inspections in 2003, united nations weapons inspectors led by hans blix, searched iraqi sites again, but found no new weapons. in march 2003, an american-led coalition invaded and occupied iraq. after a year-long investigation by an american weapons inspections team, headed by david kay, found that no large stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction (though a clandestine network of un-inspected and sealed laboratories did exist).
