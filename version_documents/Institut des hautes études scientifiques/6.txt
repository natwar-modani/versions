the institut des hautes études scientifiques (ihés; english: institute of advanced scientific studies) is a french institute supporting advanced research in mathematics and theoretical physics. it is located in bures-sur-yvette just south of paris. it is now part of the federal university of paris-saclay as an advanced studies institute.

history
the ihés, was founded in 1958 by businessman and mathematical physicist léon motchane with the help of robert oppenheimer and jean dieudonné as a research centre in france, modeled on the renowned institute for advanced study in princeton, united states.
	

the strong personality of alexandre grothendieck and the broad sweep of his revolutionizing theories were a dominating feature of the first ten years at the ihés. rené thom received an invitation from ihés in 1963 and after his appointment remained there until his retirement in 1988.  dennis sullivan is remembered as one who had a special talent for encouraging fruitful exchanges among visitors and provoking a new and deeper insight into their ideas.

the ihés runs a highly regarded mathematical journal, publications mathématiques de l'ihés.

ihés celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008 and the 40th anniversary in 1998.
