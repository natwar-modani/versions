history
the ihés, was founded in 1958 by businessman and mathematical physicist léon motchane with the help of robert oppenheimer and jean dieudonné as a research centre in france, modeled on the renowned institute for advanced study in princeton, united states.
	

the strong personality of alexander grothendieck and the broad sweep of his revolutionizing theories were a dominating feature of the first ten years at the ihés. rené thom received an invitation from ihés in 1963 and after his appointment remained there until his death in 2002.  dennis sullivan is remembered as one who had a special talent for encouraging fruitful exchanges among visitors and provoking a new and deeper insight into their ideas.

the ihés runs a highly regarded mathematical journal, publications mathématiques de l'ihés.

ihés celebrated its 40th anniversary in 1998 and its 50th in 2008.
