what is the chemical and international names please ?

in the usa the brand name is "lortab" and it's distributed (by prescription) in 500mg tablets.  i suspect other doses are available but 500mg are the only ones i've seen.  worked wonders for my toothache! zerbey 20:37, 22 sep 2004 (utc)

the original and most common brand name is vicodin in the us.  also, tylox is the brand name for percocet, not hydrocodone.  someone might want to check the other brand names to see if they're correct.

500mg, that's insane and quite misleading. the pills come in many different combinations of hydrocodone-bitartrate and acetaminophen sometimes upto 10mg and 650mg respectively (lorcet) , and medically speaking it isn't right to add the two numbers together. 
i suspect that's the case here (i did doublecheck the bottle, though) so the mistake lies with my pharmacist.  i suspect 500mg of pure hydrocodone would be fatal. zerbey 21:17, 4 apr 2005 (utc)

what are schedules ?

the schedules refer to the class of "controlled" substance, i believe.
it's schedule ii in the us just like all strong opiods

 deadly dose 

anybody knows what is the deadly dose of vicodin?
500mg might be a deadly dose.
vicodin is paired with acetaminophen to maximize the results of the hydrocodone-bitartrate, the vicodin is sold in many ratios, http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/hydrocod.htm. my prescription for example said 500mg vicodin - but that is rather 500mg of acetaminophren and 5mg of hydrocodone. it is slightly misleading. undoubtably your heart would stop and you would probalby be very sick to your stomach before that would happen. the acetaminophen is toxic when combined with alcohol in your liver. though i don't really know why. i wouldn't mind this article being converted to a stub, it doesn't contain much information on the types, ratios, or even that they always contain acetaminophren.--x1987x 20:52, 3 apr 2005 (utc)

hyrdrocodone (lortab; lorcet) comes in 5, 7.5 and 10 mg oral dosages.  the 500 mg that you mention is the amount of acetamenophen in combination with the hydrocodone.  a 500 mg dose of lortab would, i'm sure, be deadly to anyone, even the most tolerant addict.  generally the dosages are 5mg/500 mg; 7.5mg/500 mg or 10mg/500 mg in lortab. the difference with lorcet is that the mg of acetaminophen is higher, generally 650 mg or 1000 mg.  i have been taking lortab 7.5 for just over 3 years for a chronic pain condition (4 doses per day).  at times, i have had to take 2 pills instead of 1, which meant i had to skip a dose later that day or the next.  i am tolerant to the medication now so do not get the euphoric effect, even if i take 2 at a time.  however, i am quite certain that if i took 66 2/3 7.5 mg pills (the equivilant of 500 mg), i would die.

my only source for this information is my personal experience and what i read on the prescription bottles and the paperwork that comes with my prescriptions.  i used to used cvs pharmacy, but now use fred's.  both places are very good about answering questions about the medications i have to take - believe me, i've annoyed the heck out of the pharmacists - i have ocd and i ask millions of questions about everything.

>my only source for this information is my personal experience 

well apparently you were not very successful.

 when is a stub not a stub? 

this now contains a fair amount of information.  should the stub marker be removed?tej 02:16, 25 october 2005 (utc)

 comparison of oral codeine and oral hydrocodone 

the article currently states that : "the typical therapeutic dose of 5 mg to 10 mg is pharmacologically equivalent to 200 to 400 mg of oral codeine."  this is total nonsense.  the general rule of thumb is that hydrocodone is 6 times more potent than codeine on a per milligram basis, when taken orally.  while some people would argue that 8 times more potent is closer to the mark, there is absolutely no way that hydrocodone is 40 times more potent.

right you are. for example, a norco 5/325 (5 mg hydrocodone) is pretty much equivilant to a tylenol # 3 (30 mg codeine). changed article to reflect this.osmodiar 18:03, 22 november 2005 (utc)
