what is the chemical and international names please ?

in the usa the brand name is "lortab" and it's distributed (by prescription) in 500mg tablets.  i suspect other doses are available but 500mg are the only ones i've seen.  worked wonders for my toothache! zerbey 20:37, 22 sep 2004 (utc)

the original and most common brand name is vicodin in the us.  also, tylox is the brand name for percocet, not hydrocodone.  someone might want to check the other brand names to see if they're correct.

what are schedules ?

the schedules refer to the class of "controlled" substance, i believe.
it's schedule ii in the us just like all strong opiods

 deadly dose 

anybody knows what is the deadly dose of vicodin?
500mg might be a deadly dose.
vicodin is paired with acetaminophen to maximize the results of the hydrocodone, the vicodin is sold in many ratios, http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/hydrocod.htm. my prescription for example said 500mg vicodin - but that is rather 500mg of acetaminophren and 5mg of hydrocodone. it is slightly misleading. undoubtably your heart would stop and you would probalby be very sick to your stomach before that would happen. the acetaminophen is toxic when combined with alcohol in your liver. though i don't really know why. i wouldn't mind this article being converted to a stub, it doesn't contain much information on the types, ratios, or even that they always contain acetaminophren.
