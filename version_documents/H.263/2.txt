h.263 is a video codec designed by the itu-t as a low-bitrate encoding solution for videoconferencing.  it was first designed to be utilized in h.324 based systems (pstn and other circuit-switched network videoconferencing and videotelephony), but has since found use in h.323 (rtp/ip-based videoconferencing), h.320 (isdn-based videoconferencing), rtsp (streaming media) and sip (internet conferencing) solutions as well.

h.263 was developed as an evolutionary improvement based on experience from h.261, the previous itu-t standard for video compression, and the mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 standards.  its first version was completed in 1995 and provided a suitable replacement for h.261 at all bitrates.  it was further enhanced in projects known as h.263v2 (a.k.a. h.263+ or h.263 1998) and h.263v3 (a.k.a. h.263++ or h.263 2000).

the next enhanced codec developed by the itu-t (in partnership with mpeg) after h.263 is the h.264 standard, also known as avc and mpeg-4 part 10.  as h.264 provides a significant improvement in capability beyond h.263, the h.263 standard is now considered primarily a legacy design (although this is a recent development).  most new videoconferencing products now include h.264 as well as h.263 and h.261 capabilities.
