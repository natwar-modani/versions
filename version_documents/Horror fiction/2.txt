horror fiction is a genre of fiction in any medium intended to scare, unsettle, or horrify the audience. historically, the cause of the "horror" experience has often been the intrusion of a disturbing supernatural element into everyday human experience.  since the 1960s, any work of fiction with a morbid, gruesome, surreal, or exceptionally suspenseful or frightening theme has come to be called "horror".  horror fiction often overlaps science fiction or fantasy, all three categories of which are sometimes placed under the umbrella classification speculative fiction.

haunting is sometimes used as a plot device in horror fiction and paranormal-based fiction. legends about haunted houses have long appeared in literature. for example, the arabian nights tale of "ali the cairene and the haunted house in baghdad" revolves around a house haunted by jinns.  the influence of the arabian nights on modern horror fiction is certainly discernible in some of the work of h. p. lovecraft.

achievements in horror fiction are recognized by numerous awards. the  horror writer's association presents the bram stoker awards for superior achievement, named in honor of bram stoker, author of the seminal horror work, dracula. the international horror guild presents its own annual awards, as do organisations such as the australian horror writers association with its annual australian shadows award. other important awards for horror literature are as subcategories included within general awards for fantasy and science fiction in such awards as the aurealis award.

today horror is one of the most popular categories of film.
