hops are the flowers of the humulus lupulus, or hop, vine used as a flavor and stability agent in beer.  hop acids have a mild antibiotic effect against gram positive bacteria which favors the exclusive activity of brewer's yeast in the fermentation of beer.  the flavor imparted by hops varies greatly by variety and use; hops boiled with the beer produce a bitterness while hops added to beer later impart some degree of "hop flavor" and "hop aroma".  flavors and aromas are described appreciatively using terms including: grassy, floral, citrusy, and spicy. the first documented instance of hop cultivation is 736 a.d. in the hallertau region of present-day germany but the first mention of the use of hops in brewing is in 1079 a.d.  hops were introduced to british beers in the early 1500's and hop cultivation was begun in the united states in 1629.
