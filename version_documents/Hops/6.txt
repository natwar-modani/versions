hops are the female flower cones of the hop plant (humulus lupulus).  they are used primarily as a flavoring and stability agent in beer, and also in other beverages and in herbal medicine. the first documented use in beer is from the eleventh century.  hops contain several characteristics favorable to beer, balancing the sweetness of the malt with bitterness, contributing flowery, citrus, fruity or herbal aromas, and having an antibiotic effect that favors the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms.  the hop plant is a vigorous climbing herbaceous perennial, usually grown up strings in a field called a  hopfield, hop garden or hop yard.  many different varieties of hops are grown by farmers all around the world, with different types being used for particular styles of beer.

history

[[image:pasvitinys coa.gif|thumb|right|hops in the coat of arms of pa≈°vitinys, lithuania]]

the first recorded reference to hops was by pliny the elder in his naturalis historia.  the first documented instance of hop cultivation was in 736, in the hallertau region of present-day germany, although the first mention of the use of hops in brewing in that country was 1079.
not until the thirteenth century in germany did hops begin to start threatening the use of gruit for flavoring. in britain, hopped beer was first imported from holland around 1400; however, hops were initially condemned in 1519 as a "wicked and pernicious weed". in 1471, norwich, england banned the plant from the use in the brewing of beer, and it wasn't until 1524 that hops were first grown in southeast england. it was a further century before hop cultivation began in the present-day united states in 1629.

world production

as of 2005, the ten leading countries for hop cultivation (based on reported total productionb.12.11.02.tableau global.xls) were:

important production centers are the hallertau valley in germany (which, in 2006, had more hop-growing area than any other country in the world),http://www.hmelj-giz.si/ihgc/doc/5-ec%20table%20nov06.pdf and the yakima (washington) and willamette (oregon) valleys in the united states.ncgr-corvallis humulus genetic resources the principal production centres in the uk are in kent (which produces kent golding hops) and worcestershire. untitled document  essentially all of the harvested hops are used in beer making.

global prices for hops (along with barley and malt) are currently on the rise due to a combination of prolonged drought conditions in australia, north america and new zealand, a poor harvest in europe, increasing fuel prices and the rising demand for corn ethanol in the united states.beer prices rising amid crop shortage

this increase will likely see an increase in the price of beer.

until mechanisation, the need for massed labor at harvest time meant hop-growing had a big social impact.  for example, many of those hop picking in kent, a hop region first mechanised in the 1960s, were eastenders.  for them, the annual migration meant not just money in the family pocket but a welcome break from the grime and smoke of london. whole families would come down on special trains and live in hoppers' huts and gradients for most of september, even the smallest children helping in the fields.connie's homepage - hop picking in kentgeorge orwell: hop-picking

sonoma county in california was, pre-mechanisation, a major us producer of hops.  as in other hop-growing regions, the labour-intensive harvesting work involved large numbers of migrant workers travelling from other parts of the state or elsewhere for the annual hop harvest.   
  during the great depression, many workers were migrant labourers from oklahoma and the surrounding region who had recently come to california.  others included locals, particularly older school children.  sometimes whole families would work in the harvest.  the remnants of this significant hop industry are still noticeable in the form of old hop kilns that survive in sonoma county.  in part because of the hop industry's importance to the county, local florian dauenhauer of santa rosa, the seat of sonoma county, created one of the earliest and most significant hop-harvesting machines but ironically this mechanisation helped destroy the local industry.     it enabled large-scale mechanised production which moved to larger farms in other areas.

hops may be used fresh ("wet") or may be dried in an oast before they are used in the brewing process. hop resins are composed of two main acids: alpha and beta acids.

alpha acids have a mild antibiotic/bacteriostatic effect against gram-positive bacteria, and favor the exclusive activity of brewing yeast in the fermentation of beer.

beta acids do not isomerise during the boil of wort, and have a negligible effect on beer flavor.  instead they contribute to beer's bitter aroma, and high beta acid hop varieties are often added at the end of the wort boil for aroma.  beta acids may oxidize into compounds that can give beer off-flavors of rotten vegetables or cooked corn.

the flavor imparted by hops varies by type and use: hops boiled with the beer (known as "bittering hops") produce bitterness, while hops added to beer later impart some degree of "hop flavour" (if during the final 10 minutes of boil) or "hop aroma" (if during the final 3 minutes, or less, of boil) and a lesser degree of bitterness.  adding hops after the wort has cooled and the beer has fermented is known as "dry hopping", and adds hop aroma, but no bitterness. the degree of bitterness imparted by hops depends on the degree to which otherwise insoluble alpha acids (aas) are isomerized during the boil, and the impact of a given amount of hops is specified in international bitterness units. unboiled hops are only mildly bitter.

flavors and aromas are described appreciatively using terms which include "grassy", "floral", "citrus", "spicy", "piney" and "earthy". most of the common commercial lagers have fairly low hop influence, while true pilseners should have noticeable noble hop aroma and certain ales (particularly the highly-hopped style known as india pale ale, or ipa) can have high levels of bitterness.

other uses
the only major commercial use for hops is in beer, although hops are also an ingredient in julmust, a carbonated beverage similar to cola soda that is popular in sweden during december.  hops are also used in herbal medicine in a way similar to valerian, as a treatment for anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. a pillow filled with hops is a popular folk remedy for sleeplessness.  hops may be used alone, but more frequently it is combined with other herbs, like valerian.  the relaxing effects of hops is largely due to a specific chemical component: dimethylvinyl carbinol.  in using hops, be sure to get it fresh.  it tends to be unstable when exposed to light or air and loses its potency after a few months' storage.bourne, edmund j.
