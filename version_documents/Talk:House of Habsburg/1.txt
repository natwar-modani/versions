spelling

hapsburg or habsburg - which is more commonly used?
six of one...i think the p has an edge in english, but not necessarily "right" - jhk

google sez:

habsburg 32,100
hapsburg 16,400

and that includes filtering for pages in english only. -- paul drye 
 
the correct form is definitely "habsburg". the "p" is an error derived from the hardness of the german pronunciation. no habsburg would ever have called him/herself a hapsburg.

 galicia 

i think the wrong galicia is linked to in this article.

'galicia' here refers to an area now covered by south-east poland and ukraine around  the city of l'viv/lvov/lemburg which was definitely part of the austro-hungarian empire up to wwi, unlike the region of the same (english) name in north-west spain.

actually, both galicias are on the linked page. look down further! <g>. i suppose they could be separated and disambiguated? -- someone else 02:23, 18 aug 2003 (utc)
