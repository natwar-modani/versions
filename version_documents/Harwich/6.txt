because of its strategic position, harwich was the target for the invasion of britain by william of orange on 11 november 1688. however, unfavourable winds forced his fleet to sail into the english channel instead and eventually land at torbay. due to the involvement of the schomberg family in the invasion, charles louis schomberg was made marquess of harwich. 

writer daniel defoe devotes a few pages to the town in a tour thro' the whole island of great britain. visiting in 1722, he noted its formidable fort and harbour "of a vast extent".daniel defoe, a tour thro' the whole island of great britain (1724-1726) available online here the town, he recounts, was also known for an unusual spring rising on beacon hill (a promontory to the north-east of the town), which "petrified" clay, allowing it to be used to pave harwich's streets and build its walls. the locals also claimed that "the same spring is said to turn wood into iron", but defoe put this down to the presence of "copperas" in the water. regarding the atmosphere of the town, he states: "harwich is a town of hurry and business, not much of gaiety and pleasure; yet the inhabitants seem warm in their nests and some of them are very wealthy".

 architecture

despite, or perhaps because of, its small size harwich is highly regarded in terms of architectural heritage, and the whole of the older part of the town, excluding navyard wharf, is a conservation area.harwich society, 2008.

the regular street plan with principal thoroughfares connected by numerous small alleys indicates the townâ€™s medieval origins, although many buildings of this period are hidden behind 18th century facades.

the extant medieval structures are largely private homes.  the house featured in the image of kings head st to the left is unique in the town and is an example of a sailmaker's house, thought to have been built circa 1600.  notable public buildings include the parish church of st. nicholas (1821)uk attraction: st. nicholas church. in a restrained gothic style, with many original furnishings, including a somewhat altered organ in the west end gallery. there is also the guildhall of 1769, the only grade i listed building in harwich.harwich society, 2008.

the pier hotel of 1860 and the building that was  the great eastern hotel of 1864 can both been seen on the quayside, both reflecting the town's new importance to travellers following the arrival of the railway line from colchester in 1854. in 1923, the great eastern hotel was closed by the newly formed lner, as the great eastern railway had opened a new hotel with the same name at the new passenger port at parkeston quay, causing a decline in numbers.
the hotel became the harwich town hall, which included the magistrates court and, following changes in local government, was sold and divided into apartments.  

also of interest are the high lighthouse (1818), the unusual treadwheel crane (late 17th century), the old custom houses on west street, a number of victorian shopfronts and the electric palace cinema (1911), one of the oldest purpose-built cinemas to survive complete with its ornamental frontage and original projection room still intact and operational.
