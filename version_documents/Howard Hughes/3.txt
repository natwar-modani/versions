 youth 
hughes was born in houston, texas. as a teenager, he declared that his goals in life were to become the world's best golfer, the world's best pilot, and the world's best movie producer. in 1923 while attending rice university he inherited the highly profitable hughes tool company from his father, howard r. hughes, sr., who invented the diamond-studded drill bit for oil wells. he dropped out of rice and became ceo of hughes tool in 1924 at the age of 19.

hughes the aviator and engineer
in aviation, hughes set many world records, and designed and built aircraft for as well as heading hughes aircraft (merged with raytheon in 1998).  

in 1938, the william p. hobby airport in houston, texas, known at the time as the houston municipal airport, was named after him as "howard hughes airport", but the name was changed back since people opposed naming the airport after someone alive at the time.

in 1946, hughes flew the first flight of the experimental plane, the xf-11.  his flight plan included a tour of los angeles to show off the new plane, but an oil leak forced one of the counter-rotating propellers to reverse direction.  hughes tried to save the craft by landing it on the los angeles country club golf course, but seconds before he reached his attempted destination the plane started dropping dramatically and the aircraft crashed into the beverly hills neighborhood that surrounded the country club.  when the plane finally stopped after clipping three houses, the fuel tanks exploded setting fire to the home and surrounding area.  hughes lay beside his burning airplane dying until he was rescued by a marine master sergeant who was visiting friends next door.  the injuries he sustained in the crash, including a crushed collar bone, six broken ribs and third-degree burns, affected him until his death, and many attribute his long addiction to opiates to the large amounts of morphine he was prescribed for the injuries.  the trademark mustache he wore later in life was an attempt to cover a minor facial scar from the incident.

one of his greatest endeavors was the spruce goose, a massive flying boat completed just after the end of world war ii. the spruce goose only flew once (with hughes at the controls) in 1947.  because the u.s. government denied him the use of metal, hughes built the entire plane from wood (the plane was constructed of birch rather than spruce) in his westchester, california facility to fulfill his contract.  the plane was on display alongside the rms queen mary in long beach, california for many years before being moved to mcminnville, oregon.

on january 19, 1937 hughes set a new air record by flying from los angeles to new york city in 7 hours, 28 minutes and 25 seconds.  then on july 10, 1938 he set another new record by completing a 91 hour airplane flight around the world.

hughes: businessman, movie producer, and philanthropist
his best-known film may be the outlaw starring jane russell. he also wooed many of hollywood's most famous actresses, including katharine hepburn and ava gardner.  as a producer his films the racket in 1928, and the front page in 1931 were nominated for oscars.

he bought into transcontinental & west airline (later twa) in 1937 and acquired rko in 1948. he was forced to sell out of twa in 1966 for around $500m. hughes space and communications was founded in 1961. during the 1970s, hughes went back into the airline business, buying airline air west and renaming it to hughes airwest.

in 1953, hughes launched the howard hughes medical institute formed with the goal of basic biomedical research including trying to understand in hughes' words: "genesis of life itself".  it was initially viewed by many as a tax haven for his wealth, and was the topic of a protracted legal battle between hughes and the internal revenue service which hughes ultimately won.  after his death in 1976, the institute grew dramatically to become one of the most significant philanthropical organizations devoted to biological and medical research with a 2002 endowment of $11 billion.

hughes and espionage
in 1972, hughes was approached by the cia to help secretly recover a soviet nuclear submarine which had sunk near hawaii four years before. he agreed. thus the hughes glomar explorer, a special-purpose salvage vessel, was born. hughes's involvement provided the cia with a plausible cover story, having to do with civilian marine research at extreme depths. in 1974 the glomar explorer successfully raised the soviet vessel, which yielded two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines.

unfortunately though, during the recovery a mechanical failure in the grapple caused half of the submarine to break off, falling to the ocean floor.  this section is said to have held many of the most sought after items.  but despite the official report of the lost portion, much controversy surrounds this rumor.  some conflicting reports say that the entire submarine was recovered and that the cia released disinformation to leave the soviets with the impression that the mission was unsuccessful.

hughes the recluse
as time passed, hughes developed debilitating symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd). he became a recluse, living a drug-addled life locked in darkened rooms and terrified of germs. he moved from hotel to hotel, from the beverly hills hotel to boston to las vegas, where he bought the desert inn (because they threatened to evict him) and several other hotel/casinos (castaways, new frontier, landmark, sands and silver slipper). he was known for modernizing las vegas by buying it from the mafia.  he bought television stations such as klas-tv in las vegas so that there would be something to watch when he was up all night with insomnia.  he became addicted to codeine and other painkillers, was extremely frail, wore kleenex boxes as shoes, and stored his urine in jars.  as he deteriorated, he moved to the bahamas, vancouver, london, and several other places, always living in the top floor penthouse with the windows blacked out. every time he moved out, the hotel seemed to need to remodel to clean up after him.  hughes died of renal failure on an airplane en route from his penthouse in mexico to the methodist hospital in houston on 5 april, 1976 at the age of 70.  much of his strange behavior at the end of his life has been attributed to tertiary stage syphilis by modern biographers.

melvin dumar claimed that in 1975, he picked up howard hughes as a hitchhiker, and that after giving hughes the ride, hughes made dumar sole inheritor of the hughes estate.  however, subsequent court proceedings proved dumar's claims to be fraudulent.  the movie melvin and howard details this story (
