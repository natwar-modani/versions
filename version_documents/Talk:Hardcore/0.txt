i just wanted to say that bands like madball, sick of it all or 25 ta life could be added to the hardcore-metal bands list but... sepultura is not hardcore! it's not even close to the type of sound here described (which i think is a good hardcore-sound description). sepultura is a death metal band! perhaps with some diferent beliefs, but they're not an hardcore band! they are agnostic front and sick of it all friends, but i repeat... they're not an hardcore band!
and metallica are neither!
ok, ok!  all right, already!  i just put metallica in there becuase of their affinity with hardcore (discharge/ mifits earth a.d.), but you're right, they belong elsewhere.  i don't know who put sepultura in there, though.

there shouldn't be any ra-ra chants like "brotherhood! unity!" because wikipedia has a policy of a neutral point of view.  read it.
