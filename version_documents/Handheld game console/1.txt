a handheld game console is a completely autonomous video game console in that controls, screen and audio outputs are built-into the unit. the game boy, released in 1989 by nintendo, popularized the handheld console.  they are usually not considered consoles, but instead considered handhelds.

a handheld game console should meet the following standards:
it is a fully integrated unit, with a video display and audio output (speakers and/or headphone jacks.)  as such, systems like the sega mega jet, which do not have an integral display, do not qualify.
the system has its own internal power (either removable batteries, or a rechargable battery pack).  external power may be an option, however.
the system is not dedicated, meaning that different titles may be loaded into it.

the following is a list of some handhelds, past, present, and future.
