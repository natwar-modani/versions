the holographic principle is a speculative conjecture by gerard 't hooft of quantum gravity theories that all of the
information contained in a volume of space can be represented by a theory that lives in
the boundary of that region.  in other words, if you have a room then you can model
all of the events within that room by creating a theory that only takes into account 
what happens in the walls of the room.  the holographic principle also states that
at most there is one degree of freedom per planck area in that theory.
