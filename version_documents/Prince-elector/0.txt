the electors (german: kurfürsten) had the function of electing the german kings, though early on they often simply formalized what was in fact a dynastic succession. the german kings would then become emperors of the holy roman empire.  emperor charles iv regulated who would be electors in a golden bull of 1356.

the high imperial positions of electors were held by three archbishops (the archbishop of mainz, cologne and trier) and four secular rulers (the king of bohemia, duke of saxony, margrave of brandenburg and rhineland palatinate count). 

later, the dukes of bavaria and brunswick-lüneburg (hanover) were added, and in 1803 (just before the empire was abolished by napoleon bonaparte) also baden, wuerttemberg and hesse.
