from an old 1911 encyclopedia 

heinrich abeken (1809-1872), german theologian and prussian official, was born at berlin on the 8th of august 1809.  he studied theology at berlin and in 1834 became chaplain to the prussian embassy in rome.  in 1841 he visited england, being commissioned by king frederick william iv to make arrangements for the establishment of the protestant bishopric of jerusalem.  in 1848 he received an appointment in the prussian ministry for foreign affairs, and in 1853 was promoted to be privy councillor of legation (geheimer legationsrath).  he was much employed by bismarck in the writing of official despatches, and stood high in the favour of king william, whom he often accompanied on his journeys as representative of the foreign office.  he was present with the king during the campaigns of 1866 and 1870-71.  in 1851 he published anonymously babylon und jerusalem, a slashing criticism of the views of the countess von hahn-hahn (q.v.).
