 for the state of mind see hypnosis.

hypnotic drugs induce sleep (which differentiates them from the sedative category), used in the treatment of insomnia and in surgical anesthesia. often the treatment of insomnia will not begin with drugs at all. since many hypnotic drugs are habit-forming, a physician will usually recommend alternative sleeping patterns and exercise before prescribing medication for sleep, due to a large number of factors known to disturb the human sleep pattern.

these drugs include:

 barbiturates
 opioids
 benzodiazepines
 estazolam
 flunitrazepam
 midazolam
 nitrazepam
 temazepam
 triazolam
 nonbenzodiazepines
 zolpidem
 zaleplon
 zopiclone
 eszopiclone
 antihistamines
 diphenhydramine
 doxylamine
 hydroxyzine
 promethazine
 gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (xyrem)
 glutethimide
 chloral hydrate
 ethchlorvynol
 levomepromazine
 chlormethiazole
 alcohol is also used as a hypnotic drug, though not medically. to quote the british national formulary: "alcohol is a poor hypnotic because its diuretic action interferes with sleep during the latter part of the night. alcohol also disturbs sleep patterns, and so can worsen sleep disorders"
