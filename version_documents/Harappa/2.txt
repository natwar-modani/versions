in 2005 a controversial amusement park scheme at the site was abandoned when builders encountered large quantities of artifacts during the beginning of construction work. a plea from the prominent pakistani archaeologist ahmed hasan dani to the ministry of culture resulted in a re-survey of the site and cancellation of the project amid accusations of corruption and incompetence.
