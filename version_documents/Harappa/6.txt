harappa (urdu: , hindi: हड़प्पा) is a city in punjab, northeast pakistan, about 35 km (22 miles) southwest of sahiwal.

the modern town is located near the former course of the ravi river and also beside the ruins of an ancient fortified city, which was part of the cemetery h culture and the indus valley civilization.  

this ancient settlement existed from about 3300 bce and is believed to have had as many as 23,500 residents—considered large for its time.  although the harappa culture extended well beyond the bounds of present day pakistan, its centres were in sindh and the punjab.basham, a. l.  1968. review of a short history of pakistan by a. h. dani (with an introduction by i. h. qureshi).  karachi: university of karachi press.  1967 pacific affairs 41(4) : 641-643.

in 2005 a controversial amusement park scheme at the site was abandoned when builders unearthed many archaeological artifacts during the early stages of construction work. a plea from the prominent pakistani archaeologist ahmed hasan dani to the ministry of culture resulted in a restoration of the site.tahir, zulqernain. 26 may 2005. probe body on harappa park, dawn.  retrieved 13 january 2006.

 history 
one of the most fascinating yet mysterious cultures of the ancient world is the harappan civilization. this culture existed along the indus river in present day pakistan and india. it was named after the city of harappa which it was centered around.  harappa and the city of mohenjo-daro were the greatest achievements of the indus valley civilization. these cities are well known for their impressive, organized and regular layout, road and street network, drainage and step-wells for water. over one hundred other towns and villages also existed in this region. only part of this language has been deciphered today, leaving numerous questions about this civilization unanswered.

the indus valley civilization (also known as harappan culture) has its earliest roots in cultures such as that of mehrgarh,  approximately 6000 bc. the two greatest cities, mohenjo-daro and harappa, emerged circa 2600 bc along the indus river valley in punjab and sindh. the civilization, with a writing system, urban centers, and  diversified social and economic system, was rediscovered in the 1920s after excavations at mohenjo-daro (which means "mound of the dead") in sindh near sukkur, and harappa, in west punjab south of lahore. a number of other sites stretching from the himalayan foothills in east punjab, india in the north, to gujarat in the south and east, and to balochistan in the west have also been discovered and studied.  although the archaeological site at harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the lahore-multan railroad used brick from the harappa ruins for track ballast, an abundance of artifacts have nevertheless been found.kenoyer, j.m., 1997, trade and technology of the indus valley: new insights from harappa pakistan, world archaeology, 29(2), pp. 260-280, high definition archaeology

the harappa civilization existed by the banks of indus river for more than 3000 years ending somewhere around 2000 - 1500 bc.
their trade activities included both exchange of goods as well as paying by money which was represented by bronze coins that were found at the site during the excavation.
their trade with mesopotamia took place both by road and river as they had floating goods carriers for the purpose.

the secret of the existence of such advanced civilization and their sudden fall is still a mystery.

 culture and economy

indus valley civilization possibly a proto-dravid jain civilization,  was mainly an urban culture sustained by surplus agricultural production and commerce, the latter including trade with sumer in southern mesopotamia. both mohenjo-daro and harappa were built according to similar plans of well-laid-out streets, "differentiated living quarters, flat-roofed brick houses, and fortified administrative or religious centers."library of congress: country studies. 1995. harappan culture. retrieved 13 january 2006. weights and measures were roughly the same (though not fully standardized) throughout the area and distinctive seals were used, among other applications,  for identification of property and shipment of goods. although copper and bronze were in use, iron was still not employed. most hindu mythology talk about iron chariots and horses, which are missing from ivs. "cotton was woven and dyed for clothing; wheat, rice, and a variety of vegetables and fruits were cultivated; and a number of animals, including the humped bull, were domesticated."  wheel-made pottery—some of it adorned with animal and geometric motifs—has been found in profusion at all the major indus sites. a centralized administration for each city, though not the whole civilization,  has been inferred from the revealed cultural uniformity; however, it remains uncertain whether authority lay with a commercial oligarchy.  there appears to be a complete lack of priestly "pomp or lavish display" that was common in other civilizations.

 archaeology 
by far the most exquisite but most obscure artifacts unearthed to date are the small, square steatite seals engraved with human or animal motifs. large numbers of the seals have been found at mohenjo-daro, many bearing pictographic inscriptions generally thought to be a kind of script. despite the efforts of philologists from all parts of the world, and despite the use of modern cryptographic analysis, the script remains undeciphered. it is also unknown if it reflects proto-dravidian, proto-sramanic (jain), non-vedic (non-hindu or non-brahmnic), or is perhaps related to brāhmī script. similar brāhmī inscriptions can be found at various jain sites of present day tamil nadu in india.

notes

 the earliest radiocarbon dating mentioned on the web is 2725+-185 bce (uncalibrated) or 3338, 3213, 3203 bce calibrated, giving a midpoint of 3251 bce. kenoyer, jonathan mark (1991) urban process in the indus tradition: a preliminary report. in harappa excavations, 1986-1990: a multidisciplanary approach to third millennium urbanism, edited by richard h. meadow: 29-59. monographs in world archaeology no.3. prehistory press, madison wisconsin.
 periods 4 and 5 are not dated at harappa. the termination of the harappan tradition at harappa falls between 1900 and 1500 bce.
 mohenjo-daro is another major city of the same period, located in sindh province of pakistan.
 dholavira is an ancient metropolitan city. the harappans used roughly the same size bricks and weights as were used in other indus cities, such as mohenjo daro and dholavira. these cities were well planned with wide streets, public and private wells, drains, bathing platforms and reservoirs. one of its most well-known structures is the so-called great bath of mohenjo daro.
