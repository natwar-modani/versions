harappa (urdu: , hindi: हड़प्पा) is a city in punjab, northeast pakistan, about 35km (22 miles) southwest of sahiwal.

the modern town is located near the former course of the ravi river and also beside the ruins of an ancient fortifed city, which was part of the cemetery h culture and the indus valley civilization.  

the ancient city existed from about 3300 bce 'earliest writing' found bbc news,  may 4, 1999. until 1600 bce and is believed to have had as many as 40,000 residents—considered large for its time.  although the harappa culture extended well beyond the bounds of present day pakistan, its centres were in sindh and the punjab.basham, a. l.  1968. review of a short history of pakistan by a. h. dani (with an introduction by i. h. qureshi).  karachi: university of karachi press.  1967 pacific affairs 41(4) : 641-643.

in 2005 a controversial amusement park scheme at the site was abandoned when builders unearthed many archaeological artifacts during the early stages of construction work. a plea from the prominent pakistani archaeologist ahmed hasan dani to the ministry of culture resulted in a restoration of the site.tahir, zulqernain. 26 may 2005. probe body on harappa park, dawn.  retrieved 13 january 2006.

 history 
the indus valley civilization (also known as harrappan culture) has its earliest roots in approximately 6000 bce in mehrgarh.  the two greatest cities, mohenjo-daro and harrappa, emerged circa 2600 bce along the indus river valley in punjab and sindh. the civilization, with a writing system, urban centers, and  diversified social and economic system, was rediscovered in the 1920s after excavations at mohenjo-daro (which means "mound of the dead") in sindh near sukkur, and harrappa, in west punjab south of lahore. a number of other sites stretching from the himalayan foothills in east punjab, india in the north, to gujarat in the south and east, and to balochistan in the west have also been discovered and studied.  although the archaeological site at harrappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the lahore-multan railroad used brick from the harrappa ruins for track ballast, an abundance of artifacts have nevertheless been found.kenoyer, j.m., 1997, trade and technology of the indus valley: new insights from harrappa pakistan, world archaeology, 29(2), pp. 260-280, high definition archaeology

 culture and economy 

indus valley civilization was mainly an urban culture sustained by surplus agricultural production and commerce, the latter including trade with sumer in southern mesopotamia. both mohenjo-daro and harrappa were built according to similar plans of well-laid-out streets, "differentiated living quarters, flat-roofed brick houses, and fortified administrative or religious centers."library of congress: country studies. 1995. harrappan culture. retrieved 13 january 2006. weights and measures were standardized throughout the area and distinctive seals were used for identification of property and shipment of goods. although copper and bronze were in use, iron was unknown. "cotton was woven and dyed for clothing; wheat, rice, and a variety of vegetables and fruits were cultivated; and a number of animals, including the humped bull, were domesticated."  wheel-made pottery—some of it adorned with animal and geometric motifs—has been found in profusion at all the major indus sites. a centralized administration has been inferred from the revealed cultural uniformity; however, it remains uncertain whether authority lay with a priestly or a commercial oligarchy.

 archaeology 

by far the most exquisite but most obscure artifacts unearthed to date are the small, square steatite seals engraved with human or animal motifs. large numbers of the seals have been found at mohenjo-daro, many bearing pictographic inscriptions generally thought to be a kind of script. despite the efforts of philologists from all parts of the world, however, and despite the use of computers, the script remains undeciphered, and it is unknown if it is proto-dravidian or proto-sanskrit.

notes

 the earliest radiocarbon dating mentioned on the web is 2725+-185 bce (uncalibrated) or 3338, 3213, 3203 bce calibrated, giving a midpoint of 3251 bce. kenoyer, jonathan mark (1991) urban process in the indus tradition: a preliminary report. in harrappa excavations, 1986-1990: a multidisciplanary approach to third millennium urbanism, edited by richard h. meadow: 29-59. monographs in world archaeology no.3. prehistory press, madison wisconsin.
 periods 4 and 5 are not dated at harrappa. the termination of the harappan tradition at harrappa falls between 1900 and 1500 bce.
 mohenjo-daro is another major city of the same period, located in sindh province of pakistan.
 dholavira is an ancient metropolitan city. the harrappans used the same size bricks and standardized weights as were used in other indus cities such as mohenjo daro and dholavira. these cities were well planned with wide streets, public and private wells, drains, bathing platforms and reservoirs. one of its most well-known structures is the great bath of mohenjo daro.

there were other highly developed cultures in adjacent regions of baluchistan, central asia and peninsular india.  
material culture and the skeletons from the harrappa cemetery and other sites testify to a continual intermingling of communities from both the west and the east. harrappa was settled before what we call the ancient indus civilization flourished, and it remains a living town today.
