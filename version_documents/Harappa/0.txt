harappa is a city in punjab, northeast pakistan, located beside a former course of the ravi river; about 35km southwest of sahiwal.

the modern town is built beside the remains of an ancient fortifed city, which was part of the
cemetery h and indus valley civilisations. the city existed from about 3300 bc [1] until 1600 bc. 

in 2005 a controversial amusement park scheme at the site was abandoned when builders encountered large quantities of artefacts during initial construction work. a plea from the prominent pakistani archaeologist ahmed hasan dani to the ministry of culture resulted in a re-survey of the site and cancellation of the project amid accusations of corruption and incompetence.

notes

[1] the earliest radiocarbon dating mentioned on the web is 2725+-185 bc (uncalibrated) or 3338, 3213, 3203 bc calibrated, giving a midpoint of 3251 bc.
maybe this comes from s.p.gupta, 1993, "longer chronology of the indus-saraswati
civilization", puratattva, no. 23, 1992-93, pp. 21-29.
[2] mohenjo-daro is another major city of the same period, located in sindh province of pakistan.
