this is the first i ever heard of the "assumption" that homosexuals choose their orientation. my careful study of the bible -- okay :-) my haphazard skimming, geez, gimme a break! -- shows absolutely nothing about choosing to have sexual desires of any sort. the bible speaks only of what to do with those desires we realize we have.

there is no small controversy over how homosexual desire arises. is is it innate (perhaps genetic), learned somehow, or what? i've never heard anyone admit, "it was then i decided to have homosexual desires." --ed poor

i agree that it's a ridiculous theory, but there are vocal conservative christians in the us who hold this position, blaming gays for their "wrong choices" and trying to reform them. these views are probably irrelevant or non-existant elsewhere, (i certainly haven't heard them in 25 years of living in germany) and that should be mentioned in the article. --axelboldt

i believe that the argument is something along the lines of: "although we may covet a neighbors's goods, it would be wrong to act upon these impulses." similarly some would argue that we have a duty not to act on homosexual or other "ungodly" desires. 

right, it's such a ridiculous theory that it's probably a staw man argument. after you knock down that straw man, you can say that having conceded that i didn't choose to be homosexual, surely you must see that i was born that way. i think this is the fallacy of the excluded middle. --ed poor
