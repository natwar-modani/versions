what universities have such codes, and can we see an example? --dmerrill

can't say off the top of my head, but my brain whirls with half-remembered anecdotes of students forced to choose between expulsion or attend a re-orientation class of sorts (diversity training?), after expressing a 'politically incorrect' opinion. generally these anecdotes were in the context of debate over gay issues, afrocentrism, feminism... vice president cheney's wife wrote a book full of such ancecdotes, concerning professors who often lost tenure or jobs because they took their academic freedom farther than political correctness allowed. i'll need at least a day. --ed poor
