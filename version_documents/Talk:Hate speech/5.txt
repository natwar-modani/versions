wrong section
"critics have argued that the term "hate speech" is a contemporary example of newspeak, used to silence critics of social policies that have been poorly implemented in a rush to appear politically correct.[7][8][9]"
this really doesn't belong in the opening section at all.  it diverts off the main discussion and should be at the bottom like criticism sections. seems like someone with an anti-pc agenda trying to hijack the specific topic. 96.31.177.52 (talk) 22:30, 5 december 2014 (utc)

 not it only diverts off the main topic, it also speaks of a concept of 'newspeak' which is a) dubious in the context of the topic itself and the opening section of the article b) a loaded term not in line with npov -policies. 

the part also says "critics have argued": none of the references actually handle such history & phenomenon of criticism. instead, they are three polemical articles verging on conspiracy theories. for example, one text claims that american population is being "obviously endangered" by population "replacement through third-world immigration"; and that this "obvious population replacement" is being hidden by alleged "multiculturalist censorship". another text's bottom line consists of baseless assertions that 'organization of the islamic conference', oic, controls the un and the us.  a third article makes nothing but a polemic allegory of 'newspeak'. these references are no
