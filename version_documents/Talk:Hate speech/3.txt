what universities have such codes, and can we see an example? --dmerrill

can't say off the top of my head, but my brain whirls with half-remembered anecdotes of students forced to choose between expulsion or attend a re-orientation class of sorts (diversity training?), after expressing a 'politically incorrect' opinion. generally these anecdotes were in the context of debate over gay issues, afrocentrism, feminism... vice president cheney's wife wrote a book full of such ancecdotes, concerning professors who often lost tenure or jobs because they took their academic freedom farther than political correctness allowed. i'll need at least a day. --ed poor

hey, take two. :-) but it does need to be more specific. i tend to doubt any university's policy actually says flat out "you can't say foo", although i could be proven wrong. universities have done some bone-headed things. more likely it is couched in other terms. also we need to discuss the rationale behind the against-hate-speech people, i.e., the high level of hate crimes. but i'm leaving work now, so maybe later or tomorrow. --dmerrill
