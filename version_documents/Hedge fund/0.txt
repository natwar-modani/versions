a hedge fund is a term used to describe any fund that isn't a conventional investment fund - that is, any fund using strategies other than investing long in bonds, equities or money markets. the term 'hedge' is used because the firms are supposed to hedge against loss in favour of stable and reliable returns, but the term covers a wide variety of firms, some of which use high-risk strategies.  within the united states, regulations by the securities and exchange commission do not allow hedge funds
to be offered to the general public and the funds are limited to purchases by qualified investors, whose investment is
more than us$100,000, or who have total incomes of over us$200,000 per year or a net worth of over us$1,000,000. 

hedge funds use alternative strategies such as selling short, arbitrage, trading options or derivatives, using leverage, investing in seemingly undervalued securities, and attempting to take advantage of the spread between current market price and the ultimate purchase price in situations such as mergers.  they can be extremely risky investments as illustrated by the example of long-term capital management.
