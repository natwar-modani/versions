we need a page on use of various types of sources, including inscriptions and coins.  i would be happy to work on this (lord knows, there are enough things i could pull off talk pages and incorporate), but would like suggestions for  things problematic that need inclusion.  please list on my to do page! jhk

we need an entry on what is in latin technically called intitulatio, or  the official titles of rulers, especially as used in formal addresses, on coins, and on charters.  what do folks think it should be called? royal titles?  titulature? honorifics?  honorifics is nicely general and will cover the titles of the elected as well as the royal. 'intitulation' is an english word (oed sez), but i prefer 'titulature' if we're going for that stem. --michaeltinkler

i like honorifics, m'self.  it should also be linked to nomenclature, so that we can get names right in article titles.  it's an interesting dilemma, though -- we need to make it clear that honorificas often do not reflect reality, but there is also a demonstrable need for simple translation of abbreviated hon's.  any suggestions for keeping it limited to a manageable scope? jhk

we have an entry above and a table of translated honorifics below? --michaeltinkler
