four ships of the royal australian navy have been named hmas sydney after sydney, the capital city of new south wales.

the first sydney was a town class light cruiser launched 29 august 1912.
the second sydney was a modified leander class light cruiser launched 22 september 1934.  originally laid down as the hms phaeton, she was purchased by the australian government before completion.  hmas sydney ii was sunk by the german raider kormoran in december 1941.  speculation abounds as to how a lightly armed and armoured raider was able to destroy a cruiser such as the sydney, including speculation that a japanese submarine was involved.  the sydney went down the loss of 645 men, her entire compliment.  it remains the single greatest australian maritime tragedy, and to this date the wreck has not been found.
