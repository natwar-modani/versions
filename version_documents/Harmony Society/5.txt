the harmony society was a christian theosophy and pietist society founded in iptingen, germany, in 1785 or 1786. due to religious persecution by the lutheran church, the harmony society moved to the united states in 1803–1804, eventually purchasing 3000 acres (12 km²) of land in butler county, pennsylvania. on february 15 1805, they, together with about 400 followers, formally organized the harmony society, placing all their goods in common.

the society was founded and led by johann george rapp (1757–1847) and his adopted son, frederick (reichert) rapp (1775–1834). the harmony society is best known for its worldly successes, eventually building three successive communities, first at harmony, then new harmony, indiana, finally settling in economy (now ambridge, pennsylvania).   
 
first settlement
in 1803, rapp and a party of two others contracted to purchase land in butler county, pennsylvania, and to this place there followed 140 families.  there they built the town of harmony.  the exigency of their condition (they had but little money) forced him to put their money into one common fund.  frederich reichert was elected to be the manager of its business, commerce, etc., and a board of elders was also elected, for the enforcement of the society's rules and regulations. in 1807 celibacy was advocated by some, and, although rapp did not entirely bar it, this gradually became a custom — there were few births in later years.agreeably to rapp's request, frederich reichert became rapp's adopted son and took the former's name.  under frederich reichert's management the society prospered, but he soon wished for a location better suited to his commercial purposes.

second settlement
the community moved in 1814 to indiana, where it acquired 3,000 acres (12 km²) on the wabash river in posey co.  here was built the town of new harmony, and the settlement entered into agriculture and manufacture on a larger scale.  owing to the scarcity of currency, distance from the eastern markets, and unfriendliness of the neighbors (being abolitionists in sentiment, disagreeable elements from kentucky, only 15 miles (25 km) away, caused them much annoyance), frederick rapp (1824) purchased a tract of 3000 acres (1215 ha) on the ohio river, 18 miles (30 km) below pittsburgh.  to this, their last home, they moved forthwith.

third settlement
they named the last town economy.  here under the business acumen of and efficient management of frederich rapp, they enjoyed such prosperity that by 1829 they dominated the trade and the markets of pittsburgh and down the ohio river.  they were attacked as a monopoly,and it was advocated that the society be dissolved by the state.  at this time the community was not neglectful of matters pertaining to art and culture.  frederick rapp purchased and installed a museum, containing fine paintings and many curios and antiquities; they had a deer park, a floral park, and a maze, or labyrinth; they also had a good orchestra, were fond of music, and gave much attention to its cultivation.  in 1832 the society suffered a serious division.  of 750 members, 250 became alienated through the influence of bernhard mueller (self-styled count de leon), who, with 40 followers (also at variance with the authorities in the old country), had come to economy to affiliate with the society.  rapp and leon could not agree;  a separation and apportionment of the property were therefore agreed upon.  this secession of one-third of the society, consisting mostly of the flower of young manhood and young womanhood, broke frederick's heart.  he died within two years.  it resulted, also in the practical destruction of the community.  the cotton, woolen, and silk factories continued in operation for a time in a desultory way and gradually closed altogether.  after rapp's death, in 1834, the management passed successively into the hands of george rapp, who died in 1847;  r. l, baker and jacob henrici, 1847-69;  j. henrici and jonathan lenz, 1869-92;  j. s. duss, 1892-1903;  susie c. duss, 1903-06.  

the high-water mark of the society's prosperity was at the close of the administration of r. l. baker in 1868;  its wealth at that time being probably $2,000,000.  by 1890, however, it was hopelessly in debt, on the verge of bankruptcy, with a depleted membership of aged people.  the society was overwhelmed with litigation on the part of would-be heirs.  disaster was averted by the efforts of j. s. duss.  he finally won the lawsuits and paid the society's indebtedness.  the great strain which he had undergone undermining his health, he was forced to resign his trusteeship in 1903.  there being but few members left, the society was formally dissolved in 1906.
