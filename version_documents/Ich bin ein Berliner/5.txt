"ich bin ein berliner" ("i am a citizen of berlin") is a famous quote from a june 26, 1963 speech of u.s. president john f. kennedy in west berlin. kennedy was underlining the support of the united states for democratic west germany shortly after soviet-controlled communist east germany had erected the berlin wall as a deadly barrier to its citizens escaping to the west.

the speech is considered one of kennedy's best, and a notable moment of the cold war. it was a great morale boost for the west berliners, who feared absorption into the soviet empire. speaking from the balcony of rathaus schöneberg, kennedy said,

"two thousand years ago the proudest boast was civis romanus sum. today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is 'ich bin ein berliner.' all free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of berlin, and, therefore, as a free man, i take pride in the words 'ich bin ein berliner!'"

this message of defiance was aimed as much at the soviets as it was at the berliners, and was a clear statement of u.s. policy in the wake of the berlin wall. however, kennedy also faced criticism inasmuch as his speech seemed to accept the new status quo following the division of berlin. kennedy said west berlin had been "besieged for 18 years" — alluding to the berlin airlift and other events — but critics said he had tacitly accepted that east berlin was part of the soviet bloc, despite the fact that all of berlin was under four-power occupation and technically part of neither west nor east germany.

today there exist commemorative sites in berlin, such as the john f. kennedy german-american school berlin, and the john f. kennedy institute for north american studies of the free university berlin.

background  

see main article: history of berlin

germany's capital, berlin, was deep within the area controlled after world war ii by the soviet army. initially governed jointly in four sectors controlled respectively by the united states, united kingdom, france, and ussr, tensions of the cold war escalated until the soviet forces implemented the berlin blockade, which the western allies relieved with the dramatic airlift.

afterward, the sectors controlled by the nato allies became an effective exclave of west germany, completely surrounded by east germany. from 1952, the border between east and west was closed everywhere but berlin. hundreds of thousands of east germans defected to the west via west berlin, a labour drain which threatened east germany with economic collapse.

in 1961 the east german government under walter ulbricht erected a barbed wire barrier around the soviet sector of berlin. though it was officially called the antifaschistischer schutzwall (anti-fascist protective barrier), it was universally known as the berlin wall and its primary purpose was to keep east german citizens from crossing to the west. over a period of months the wall was rebuilt using concrete, and buildings were demolished to create a "death zone" in view of east german guards armed with machine guns. in 1962 the first attempted escape leading to a fatal shooting took the life of peter fechter. 

the west, including the united states, was accused of failing to respond forcefully to the erection of the wall. on july 25, 1961, president kennedy, with the april bay of pigs fiasco yet fresh, broadcast a presidential address. kennedy insisted that america would defend west berlin, asserting its four-power rights, even while making it clear that challenging the soviet presence in germany was not possible.

"jelly doughnut" urban legend

a common urban legend asserts that kennedy made an embarrassing grammatical error by saying "ich bin ein berliner," referring to himself not as a citizen of berlin, but as a common pastry.
[[image:berliner-pfannkuchen.jpg|thumb|left|a berliner.]]
the legend stems from a play on words with berliner, the name given to a doughnut variant filled with jam or plum sauce that is thought to have originated in berlin. while this "jelly doughnut" is indeed common to berlin, it is only known as pfannkuchen (pan cake) in the city and nearby regions. other parts of germany picked up the pastry under the name of berliner pfannkuchen, shortened to berliner. 

according to the legend, kennedy should have said "ich bin berliner" to mean "i am a person from berlin." by adding the indefinite article ein, it is claimed, his statement implied he was a non-human berliner, thus "i am a jelly doughnut". in the legend, the statement was followed by uproarious laughter. 

this urban legend is unknown in germany, where kennedy's speech is considered a landmark in the country's postwar history. the term "berliner" for the pastry sounds strange to people in berlin. common souvenirs in berlin depicting a doughnut covered with the inscription "ich bin ein berliner," which are often thought by american tourists to refer to this legend, represent little more than a play on words.

there is no grammatical error in kennedy's statement; the indefinite article does not change its meaning. in german, statements of profession are often made without an article, thus "ich bin arzt" (i am a doctor). however, "ich bin ein arzt," while less common, is not a mistake. conversely, with statements of origin "ich bin ein brandenburger" (i am from brandenburg) is more common than "ich bin brandenburger"; however, both are correct. although both forms may be used interchangeably, the article "ein" can be used as a form of emphasis: it implies "just one of many." as kennedy did indeed stress the "ein", the usage was, according to german linguist jürgen eichhoff , "not only correct, but the one and only correct way of expressing in german what the president intended to say." 

during the speech, kennedy used the phrase twice. after he said it the first time, he was applauded, and added jokingly, "i appreciate my interpreter translating my german!" this statement was followed by laughter and applause. he also used the phrase to end his speech.

the origins of the legend are obscure, but it was perpetuated in 1988 when william j. miller erroneously wrote in an april 30th new york times article:

what they did not know, but could easily have found out, was that such citizens never refer to themselves as "berliners." they reserve that term for a favorite confection often munched at breakfast. so, while they understood and appreciated the sentiments behind the president's impassioned declaration, the residents tittered among themselves when he exclaimed, literally, "i am a jelly-filled doughnut."

although it has no basis in fact, the legend has since been repeated by other reputable media outlets, such as the bbc , the guardian , a political bloopers segment on msnbc's countdown with keith olbermann , and in several books about germany written by english-speaking authors.

furthermore, the speech had been reviewed by journalist robert lochner, who was educated in germany, and had been practiced several times in front of numerous germans, including berlin mayor willy brandt. the many video and audio recordings of the event show only enthusiastic applause following the statement.  kennedy did, however, pronounce the sentence with a strong boston accent, reading from his note "ish bin ein bearleener," which he had written out phonetically.

 the phrase and the legend in fiction and popular culture
in the x-files episode "schizogeny" mulder erroneously tells a teen with the poster "ich bin ein ausländer" that when kennedy made the statement "ich bin ein berliner" he was saying "i am a cocktail sausage" leading to the response "who's kennedy?".

the phrase is also alluded to in an episode of the simpsons entitled "little girl in the big ten."  lisa simpson is reluctant to enroll in a gymnastics school in order to help her pass her physical education class at springfield elementary.  however, after having been inspired by a vision of president kennedy while knocked unconscious, she awakes to claim "ich bin ein gymnast!". homer simpson then remarks that she must have dreamed about hitler again. also, in another episode of the series, abraham simpson has a flashback in which he hears john f. kennedy say the phrase "ich bin ein berliner," prompting abraham to yell "he's a nazi!" shortly before tackling kennedy. throughout the series, mayor "diamond joe" quimby, a caricature of the kennedys, uses variations of the phrase multiple times when addressing large crowds ("ich bin ein springfield swap meet patron!"). during one episode, when german investors purchased the springfield nuclear power plant, mayor quimby said: "ich bin ein springfielder" during the opening ceremony speech.

during a show in berlin on november 3, 1996, eddie vedder of pearl jam said to the crowd: "i don't know what to say so i'll just say this, i am a donut."

british comedian eddie izzard talks about john kennedy's "i am a doughnut" speech in his stand-up act "dress to kill".

in terry pratchett's book monstrous regiment (p. 328 of the hardcover), samuel vimes makes a speech in which he says "ze chzy brogocia proztfik!", intending this to mean "i am a citizen of borogravia!". what he actually says is "i am a cherry pancake!".

the legend also appears in berlin game, the first book in len deighton's game, set, match trilogy.
