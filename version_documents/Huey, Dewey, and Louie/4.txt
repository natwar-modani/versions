huey, dewey and louie duck are fictional characters and ducks who appear in cartoons and comic books published by the walt disney company. identical triplets, the three are donald duck's nephews. huey, dewey and louie were created by ted osborne and al taliaferro, and first appeared in a newspaper comic strip on october 17, 1937. their first animated appearance was in the theatrical short donald's nephews, released april 15, 1938.  

huey, dewey and louie are the sons of donald's sister; in donald's nephews, donald's sister is named "dumbella," but in the comics, her full name is della thelma duck. in the original theatrical shorts, they were originally sent to visit donald for only one day; in the comics, the three were sent to stay with donald on a temporarily basis, until their father came back from the hospital (the boys had wound up sending him there after a practical joke of putting firecrackers under his chair). in both the comics and animated shorts, the boys' parents were never heard from or referred to again after these instances, with the boys ending up permanently living with donald. all four of them live in the fictional city of duckburg.

the boys are noted for having both identical appearances and personalities in most appearances, with the three sometimes shown as finishing each others' sentences as a running joke. in the theatrical shorts, huey, dewey and louie would often behave in a rambunctious manner, sometimes committing retaliation or revenge on their uncle donald for something he did to them. in the comics, however, the boys usually are shown in a more well-behaved manner, usually helping their uncle donald and great-uncle scrooge mcduck in the adventure at hand.

since the production of the 1987 animated series ducktales, huey, dewey and louie can usually be told apart by the color of their hats and/or clothing: huey dresses in red, dewey in blue, and louie in green. disney's archivist dave smith, in "disney a to z," said, "note that the brightest hue of the three is red (huey), the color of water, dew, is blue (dewey), and that leaves louie, and leaves are green."  before ducktales, the colors were not applied to the individual characters consistently; each character looked the same until colored, and often which colors belonged to which duck were decided by the colorist.

animation
huey, dewey and louie appeared in a large number of theatrical shorts with donald.

they later starred in the 1987 animated television series ducktales, in which they appeared in adventures with their great-uncle, scrooge mcduck (donald having enlisted in the u.s. navy. the boys' personalities in this series were mainly based on their comic book appearances versus the theatrical shorts.

huey, dewey and louie also starred in the 1990s series quack pack, in which the three were portrayed as teenagers. in quack pack, the boys were given distinct personalities, with huey serving as the group's leader, dewey as a computer whiz, and louie as enjoying sports.

after quack pack, the boys were reverted to their original ages in future appearances, including 2000s series mickey mouse works and house of mouse. 

huey, dewey and louie were all voiced by russi taylor in ducktales. in quack pack, they were voiced by jeannie elias, pamela segall, and elizabeth daily, respectively. tony anselmo voiced the characters in house of mouse and mickey mouse works.

comics
within the comics, huey, dewey and louie often play a major role in most stories involving either their uncle donald or great-uncle scrooge mcduck, accompanying them on most of their adventures. also seen in the comics is the boys' membership in the boy scouts-like organization, the the junior woodchucks, including their use of the junior woodchuck guidebook, a manual containing all manner of information on virtually every subject possible.

in disney comic writer don rosa's comics, huey, dewey and louie duck were born in 1940 in duckburg.

trivia
on a few occasions, there is a fourth nephew that appears, slipping through by a mistake of the artist. he has been named "phooey" by disney comic editor bob foster. one short egmont-licensed disney comic explained phooey's sporadic appearances as a freak incident of nature.

in the kingdom hearts video game, huey, dewey, and louie run an item shop in traverse town. they sell items and weapons to the main characters, but refuse to give a family discount to their uncle donald.
