an inventor is a person who creates or discovers new methods, means, or devices for performing a task. the word "inventor" comes form the latin verb invenire, invent-, to find. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=inventor&db=* http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=dictionary&va=invent 

the term may also refer to those who have been granted a patent (see inventor (patent)). many things are however not patentable, or are not generally patented, and may nevertheless be considered the product of the work of an inventor. examples include new methods or products of artistic expression or mathematics. as in the case of formal inventorship (under patent law), a key element is clearly expressible surprise caused by the invention to those knowledgeable in the domain of the invention upon revelation of the invention to them.

artistic and mathematical invention

an example of the formal patenting of an artist method/process is the patent by yves klein on a particular shade of blue.http://www.indielondon.co.uk/events/out_barbican_colour_klein.html this blue color is known as "kleinian blue" or international klein blue, for an example see .. whether or not artistic invention in the general sense is formally recognizable, invention is an active part of the artist's vocabulary. an example is actor paul newman's statement of his reasons for retiring from acting, "you start to lose your memory, your confidence, your invention. so that's pretty much a closed book for me."  http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/05/26/newman_says_hes_done_with_acting/ 

inventions in mathematics may be indelibly associated with a given person, such as stirling's formula associated with
james stirling. some philosophers of mathematics dispute the notion that mathematical objects may be "invented". they propose that mathematical objects exist independently of mathematicians as abstract objects, so that mathematicians  can only "discover" them. in that sense, stirling is the discoverer of the eponymous formula, not its inventor.

 distinguished from trademark or "-esque" 

the association of a given artistic or mathematical product with a person (its "inventor") can be distinguished from discoveries which are recognizably typical or characterisic of the person's creations. such characteristics are more similar to the formal concept of trademark than the formal concept of invention. this loose concept may be indicated by appending the person's name with the suffix "esque", e.g. "rubenesque woman has picassoesque face". http://www.theonion.com/content/node/32472  the distinction between the "-esque" characteristic and trademark on an artist's name is subtle and has been litigated. http://www.sib.it/engsib/novita/tm/200106.htm 

 formal sense 

inventorship is a key determination in establishing patent rights. the system of patents was established by to encourage inventors by granting limited-term, limited monopoly on inventions determined to be sufficiently novel, non-obvious, and useful. in the u.s. the intellectual property clause of the constitution permits (but does not mandate) laws to be passed establishing patent and other intellectual property rights.
