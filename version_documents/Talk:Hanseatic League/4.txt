 whatever came of... 

wikipedia:wikiproject_hanseatic_league ? just curious, or if this is essentially it, here. pєtєrs j v ►talk 19:17, 29 april 2011 (utc)
 given there's a fair few of us working on this article at the moment; i think we should reform the wikiproject, personally. — owenblacker (talk) 23:10, 15 may 2011 (utc)
sounds good. i promise to try to write up an economics section which i mentioned before, as i still think that's the biggest glaring omission from the article, but being busy it might take me a bit of time to get around to it.volunteer marek (talk) 23:40, 15 may 2011 (utc)
 no problem; we all have real lives to lead, after all  ;o)
 i've reactivated the wikiproject and will spend a little time sorting that out over the next few days and weeks. i won't get a lot done this weekend, though, as i'll be at a one-day conference on saturday. if anyone wants to go sign up for the project, please go add yourself at wikipedia:wikiproject hanseatic league/users. — owenblacker (talk) 22:59, 17 may 2011 (utc)
 thanks for that. as a side project, can we detail all the specific errors in the penguin map? i'd like to follow up with the publisher. pєtєrs j v ►talk 23:09, 17 may 2011 (utc)

 and on the penguin map 

and as compared to the 1902 (?) map, dunaburg (daugavpils) is implied to be a foreign outpost under novgorod? the hansa has been an area of interest but i've admittedly gotten quite rusty. i was planning to dust off the cobwebs when i got to the hansa in my upgrade of the history of riga article. pєtєrs j v ►talk 19:35, 29 april 2011 (utc)

p.s. would the kontor be aided with a hierarchy indicating the primary city and satellites? just thinking out loud. pєtєrs j v ►talk 20:50, 30 april 2011 (utc)

 removal of lufthansa 

it is inaccurate to say that lufthansa is a legacy of the hansa. hansa means trade in german and lufthansa has nothing to do with the league and is not their legacy. macrhino (talk) 10:27, 14 may 2011 (utc)

although hansa might strictly speaking mean trade, this is not a common word for it, you instead say "handel". and the lufthansa name makes no sense like that as it would then mean "airtrade". the name lufthansa is a direct reference to the hanseatic league. the wording does not claim that lufthansa is a descendant of the hansa. --openfuture (talk) 13:33, 14 may 2011 (utc)

"dudesche hanse" is the old form low german version of "deutsche hanse". --saddhiyama (talk) 17:01, 16 october 2011 (utc)
i know. thats why i wrote it. shouldn't it be in the article? thats what it's used to be, a league of german merchants. the aricle just calls it hanseatic league. in german that would even be incorrect but it should at least be mentioned that their name is deutsche hanse or dudesche hanse. archeologist can identify hanse buildings all over europe just by looking at the foundation of a destroyed building and than they know whether or not a building is german and therefore a hanse building.  — preceding unsigned comment added by 178.200.46.188 (talk) 15:50, 17 october 2011 (utc) 

 names 

why are all the names given in german? (hansetag, tagfahrt) someone should translate them to what they were actually called.193.174.122.76 (talk) 19:03, 3 january 2012 (utc)
 i'd agree that the first time a historical name is used we should indicate current in parentheses. most materials of the time and later scholarship tend to use the place-names of the times, so just following normal convention here. pєtєrs j v ►talk 21:24, 3 january 2012 (utc)

hull and "subsidiary settlements"
the article appears misleading - having a branch of the hansa in the town does not make it a hansa port, or settlement.

describing hull as a "subsidiary hanseatic settlements" hanseatic_league#subsidiary_hanseatic_settlements is close to nonsense. appear on a map in a document about the hanseatic league eg  kleinere niederlassungen in handelsniederlassungen der hanse does not make it a member in any way. the only places that should be mentioed are those hansestädte - the rest were not part of the hansa - the organisation simply had offices/warehouses there.

ditto the statement in addition to the major kontors, individual hanseatic ports had a representative merchant and warehouse - is misleading - it is a too broad definition of a hanseatic port to have had a warehouse in it.. (or perhaps it means that the warehouses in non-hansa cities were run by invididual hansa ports? ) - in which case  which port ran hull, lynn, etc ??

none of the history's of hull i am aware of make any reference to it being part of the hansa, having a settlement, or even having a warehouse.. eg gent, sheahan,  nichols. in gillet & macmahon it states - p.82 "the trade between bergen and iceland was largely in the hands of the hanse merchants ... merchants of hull and bristol would have regarded it as a gross neglect of commercial fundamentals if they had not committed piracy against ships of hamburg and danzig". (not the actions of a member?) 

nevertheless, it is clear that there was trade with hansa merchant, - what is disputed is that there was any other association with the hanseatic league.oranjblud (talk) 17:54, 8 june 2012 (utc)

i changed "subsidiary hanseatic settlements" to "trading posts". but i couldn't find any evidence of an office or warehouse in hull. so that must remain disputed.oranjblud (talk) 18:01, 8 june 2012 (utc)
