"dudesche hanse" is the old form low german version of "deutsche hanse". --saddhiyama (talk) 17:01, 16 october 2011 (utc)
i know. thats why i wrote it. shouldn't it be in the article? thats what it's used to be, a league of german merchants. the aricle just calls it hanseatic league. in german that would even be incorrect but it should at least be mentioned that their name is deutsche hanse or dudesche hanse. archeologist can identify hanse buildings all over europe just by looking at the foundation of a destroyed building and than they know whether or not a building is german and therefore a hanse building.  — preceding unsigned comment added by 178.200.46.188 (talk) 15:50, 17 october 2011 (utc) 

 names 

why are all the names given in german? (hansetag, tagfahrt) someone should translate them to what they were actually called.193.174.122.76 (talk) 19:03, 3 january 2012 (utc)
 i'd agree that the first time a historical name is used we should indicate current in parentheses. most materials of the time and later scholarship tend to use the place-names of the times, so just following normal convention here. pєtєrs j v ►talk 21:24, 3 january 2012 (utc)
names are given in german because german was the official language of the hanse (low german to be totally correct, but that is a variant of german) btw the name of the hanseatic league was dudesche hanse (in low german - deutsche hanse in modern standard german)95.208.187.120 (talk) 14:55, 28 april 2013 (utc)
and since the term hanse could be translated into english as league (actually it is old high german for group) the term hanseatic league is a bit strange - i know it is the common terminology in english yet it still a bit weird ("league of the league/group")95.208.187.120 (talk) 15:02, 28 april 2013 (utc)

hull and "subsidiary settlements"
the article appears misleading - having a branch of the hansa in the town does not make it a hansa port, or settlement.

describing hull as a "subsidiary hanseatic settlements" hanseatic_league#subsidiary_hanseatic_settlements is close to nonsense. appear on a map in a document about the hanseatic league eg  kleinere niederlassungen in handelsniederlassungen der hanse does not make it a member in any way. the only places that should be mentioed are those hansestädte - the rest were not part of the hansa - the organisation simply had offices/warehouses there.

ditto the statement in addition to the major kontors, individual hanseatic ports had a representative merchant and warehouse - is misleading - it is a too broad definition of a hanseatic port to have had a warehouse in it.. (or perhaps it means that the warehouses in non-hansa cities were run by invididual hansa ports? ) - in which case  which port ran hull, lynn, etc ??

none of the history's of hull i am aware of make any reference to it being part of the hansa, having a settlement, or even having a warehouse.. eg gent, sheahan,  nichols. in gillet & macmahon it states - p.82 "the trade between bergen and iceland was largely in the hands of the hanse merchants ... merchants of hull and bristol would have regarded it as a gross neglect of commercial fundamentals if they had not committed piracy against ships of hamburg and danzig". (not the actions of a member?) 

nevertheless, it is clear that there was trade with hansa merchant, - what is disputed is that there was any other association with the hanseatic league.oranjblud (talk) 17:54, 8 june 2012 (utc)

i changed "subsidiary hanseatic settlements" to "trading posts". but i couldn't find any evidence of an office or warehouse in hull. so that must remain disputed.oranjblud (talk) 18:01, 8 june 2012 (utc)

note - the article on beverley (near hull) refers to beverley beck being a trading post of the hanseatic league with a reference - if that helps you.  — preceding unsigned comment added by 213.249.223.14 (talk) 00:33, 12 september 2013 (utc) 

 cologne hanse member after 1475? 
in the german wikipedia about the hanse is to read the following:

"auf den hansetagen 1629 und 1641 wurden hamburg, bremen und lübeck beauftragt, das beste zum wohle der hanse zu wahren. 1669 hielten die letzten in der hanse verbliebenen städte, lübeck, hamburg, bremen, danzig, rostock, braunschweig, hildesheim, osnabrück und köln den letzten hansetag in lübeck ab, wobei die drei erstgenannten den schutz der im ausland befindlichen kontore übernahmen.", see for https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanse.

the essence of this is that there were still 9 cities remaining during the last hanseday held in lübeck in 1669 incl. the town of cologne.
is there any explanation why in the english wikipedia it is noted that cologne left / has been suspended in 1475 (for ever)? wasn't it so that cologne has been excluded from the hanse in 1475 just for a while and somewhen in the aftermath cologne rejoined the hanse?

is there anyone out there who is able to give an answer about this matter?

further is there anybody who can state a reasonable translation from "kurköln" into english? or is there none translation of the prefix "kur" in this term "kurköln"?

thx so far.
