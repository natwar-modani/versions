it is asserted by some that an extinction event, comparable to others observed in the fossil record, is occuring at present.  most of those asserting that this holocene extinction event is occuring also assert that humanity is entirely responsible for it.  some specifically identify the start of this event with the dying off (or killing off) of the species homo neanderthalensis.

no one disputes that a large number of species have recently (in geologic terms) become extinct.  around 10,000 years before the present, thirty-nine mammalian genera disappeared, almost all of them large-bodied "megafauna," including 

 native american horses

 a few species of camels

 several types of large ground sloth

 several antelope species

 "short-faced" bears (larger than the present grizzly)

 sabertooth cats

 the american lion (larger than the current african lion)

 various species of mammoth 

 the american mastodon, mammut americanum

 dire wolves

 diprotodon (giant wombats)

such extinctions have continued to the present day.  within the last millennium, many other species have died off, such as 

 the aurochs

 the tasmanian wolf

 many extinct birds

much, much more to come
