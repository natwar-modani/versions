according to the bible, hezekiah (which means "whom jehovah has strengthened")was the son of ahaz (2 kings 18:1; 2
chr. 29:1), whom he succeeded on the throne of the kingdom of judah. he reigned twenty-nine years (726 bc- 697 bc). the biblical history
of this king is contained in 2 kings 18:20, isaiah 36-39, and 2
chronicles 29-32. he is spoken of as a great and good king. in public
life he followed the example of his great-granfather uzziah. he
set himself to abolish idolatry from his kingdom, and among
other things which he did for this end, he destroyed the "brazen
serpent," which had been removed to jerusalem, and had become an
object of idolatrous worship (numbers 21:9). a great reformation
was wrought in the kingdom of judah in his day (2 kings 18:4; 2
chronciles 29:3-36).

on the death of sargon and the accession of his son
sennacherib to the throne of assyria, hezekiah refused to pay
the tribute which his father had paid, and "rebelled against the
king of assyria, and served him not," but entered into a league
with egypt (isaiah 30; 31; 36:6-9). this led to the invasion of
judah by sennacherib (2 kings 18:13-16), who took forty cities,
and besieged jerusalem with mounds. hezekiah yielded to the
demands of the assyrian king, and agreed to pay him three
hundred talents of silver and thirty of gold (18:14).

but sennacherib dealt treacherously with hezekiah (isaiah 33:1),
and a second time within two years invaded his kingdom (2 kings
18:17; 2 chronicles 32:9; isaiah 36). this invasion issued in the
destruction of sennacherib's army. hezekiah prayed to god, and
"that night the angel of the lord went out, and smote in the
camp of the assyrians 185,000 men." sennacherib fled with the
shattered remnant of his forces to nineveh, where, seventeen
years after, he was assassinated by his sons adrammelech and
sharezer (2 kings 19:37).

the narrative of hezekiah's sickness and miraculous recovery
is found in 2 kings 20:1, 2 chronicles 32:24, isaiah 38:1. various
ambassadors came to congratulate him on his recovery, and among
them merodach-baladan, the viceroy of babylon (2 chronicles 32:23; 2
kings 20:12). he closed his days in peace and prosperity, and
was succeeded by his son manasseh. he was buried in the
"chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of david" (2 chr.
32:27-33). he had "after him none like him among all the kings
of judah, nor any that were before him" (2 kings 18:5).
