this is a horrible title, but i am having trouble thinking of a better one -- imperial elector?  electors of the holy roman empire?  an adjectival/genetive reference would be better than everything in the nominative...jhk
i like 'electors of the hre'

at the risk of being crude, that sounds like the name of a playboy pictorial....
mmmmmm, show me your wittelsbachs, bay-beee...

to m. tinkler and jhk
please check out kurfuersten/electors . 
also let me know about the german ( or english) names on the hohenzollern list ??
thanks  h. jonat

"...shortly before the empire was abolished by napoleon i..."

i understood that it was abolished in order to prevent the possibility of its being taken over and used by napoleon to support his legitimacy, i.e. as a consequence of him but not by him. what is the actual siuation? pml.

i also like "elector of the holy roman empire" better than this title.  as for the abolition, what happened was that napoleon created the confederation of the rhine.  the states that joined it (including bavaria, wurttemberg, and baden), seceded from the holy roman empire, and the emperor eventually decided to give up the ghost, and declared the empire at an end. i'm going to edit a bit. john 02:30 apr 30, 2003 (utc)
