 causes 
why is this article missing causes? pages such as, homosexuality and pedophilia include a "causes" section, why not this page? should it have one? 2001:8003:38f1:db00:50f2:dee5:f505:2eba (talk) 08:51, 17 october 2018 (utc)
the "academic study" study section is the causes section, in part. but research on sexual orientation is overwhelmingly about what causes homosexuality, and about other aspects concerning homosexuality. keep in mind that homosexuality includes any same-sex sexual behavior and not just a homosexual sexual orientation. because of reproduction, researchers don't see as much of a reason to focus on why people are heterosexual and why non-human animals engage in heterosexual activity. flyer22 reborn (talk) 09:46, 17 october 2018 (utc)
i see, thanks for the clear up. i was just always curious on why people don't study on causes on heterosexuality much and just thought the section was missing from the article. 2001:8003:38f1:db00:50f2:dee5:f505:2eba (talk) 10:18, 17 october 2018 (utc)

the main ultimate "cause" (if you want to call it that) is evolutionary selection for perpetuation of the species... anonmoos (talk) 23:08, 23 october 2018 (utc)
