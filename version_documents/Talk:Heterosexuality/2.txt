 article structure 

i'd like to propose the article be organised more consistently with the history of human sexuality article
 records of heterosexual behaviour 
 religious and philosophical texts from various world cultures
 literary sources
 medical texts (and later biological)
 linguistic developments in terminology, particularly in slang based on psychological studies
 more recent 19th-20th century studies of heterosexuality

hmm, this might not be worded quite right
from the lead;

"and is the only possible reproductive sexual orientation among humans without use of medical assistance." 

thats incorrect. if a man and two women or two men and woman have an unprotected threesome, they would have had bi-sexual sex that resulted in potential pregnancy. on top of that, a homosexual man can still have sex with a woman and get her pregnaunt. homosexuals don't have a lower sperm count. keep it simple, "sexual intercourse between a man and a woman can result in reproduction". — realist2 (come speak to me) 13:49, 9 july 2008 (utc)
