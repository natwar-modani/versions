a hi-hat or hihat is a type of cymbal and stand used as a typical part of a drum kit by percussionists in jazz, rock and roll, and other forms of contemporary popular music. 

 description 

the hi-hat consists of two cymbals mounted on a metal stand, with a pedal pulling down on a narrow metal shaft, which is countered by a spring attached to the bottom of the shaft that repels against the upper cybal to playing. the bottom cymbal however, is stationary and rests on the metal stand, connected to a hollow metal rod. the top cymbal can move up and down to open or close the hi-hat via the pedal. it can be played in both the open and closed positions, a partially open closed position, or making the cymbals clash together using the pedal.

 history of development 
the hi-hat originated as a cymbal turned upside down on the floor, with another cymbal tied to the  drummer's shoe, and was played by stepping on the bottom cymbal. later in the 20th century, it was raised up to sock level (just below the knee) and called a "low boy" or "sock cymbal." and operated by a pedal.  the low-sock was a pedal which simply clashed together a pair of similar crash cymbals. the cymbals were mounted next to the pedal, so playing them with a stick was not possible.
today it is called the "hi hat". the hi-hat stand was developed from the low-sock by gene krupa in collaboration with armand zildjian. 

up until the late 1960s the standard hi-hats were 14", with 13" available as a less common alternative in professional cymbal ranges and smaller sizes down to 12" restricted to children's kits. in the early 1970s heavy rock drummers (including led zeppelin's john bonham) began to use 15" hi-hats. in the late 1970s sabian released their revolutionary 10" mini hats, which were small, heavy hi-hat cymbals intended for close miking either live or recording, and other manufacturers quickly followed. however zildjian's zht line of cymbals contain 8" mini hi-hats, one of the world's smallest hi-hats. starting in the 1980s a number of manufacturers also experimented with rivets in the lower cymbal. but by the end of the 1990s the standard size was again 14", with 13" a less common alternative, and smaller hats mainly used for special sounds. rivets in hi-hats received rave reviews but failed to catch on.

modern hi-hat cymbals are much heavier than modern crash cymbals, reflecting a continual trend to lighter and thinner crash cymbals as well as to heavier hi-hats. the other change has been that a pair hi-hat cymbals are no longer necessarily similar. more typically the bottom is now heavier than the top, and may also be vented, this being one innovation to have caught on. some drummers even use completely mismatched hi-hats from different cymbal ranges, of different manufacturers and even of different sizes. 

one of the world's loudest hi-hats would have to be zildjian's 14" z custom dyno beat hi-hats. these are both extra heavy in weight, meaning very loud projection, perfect for heavy metal music. their sound is dark and tight . these hi-hats are favored my many rock drummers, especially metallica's lars ulrich, who uses these hi-hats for their volume.

another recent development is fixed and cable-controlled hi-hats. an extended drum kit will often have a second set of hi-hats, normally smaller than the main ones, mounted to the centre or to the right. these may be fixed closed or connected by a bowden cable to a pedal operated by the drummer's left foot, or more rarly, their right foot.

additionally, many drummers use a drop-clutch mechanism to disengage the top hi-hat in order to free up both feet while double bass playing. this results in the hi-hat producing a closed sound until the hi-hat foot is available again. the mechanism is disabled by fully pressing the hi-hat pedal. drop-clutches are normally controlled by a hit on the cluctch using the drumstick to release the top cymbal. by pressing the hihat pedal again, the drummer allows the clutch to grab the top cymbal back again (such as pearl's dcl-300p drop clutch. recent development from drum manufacturers have resulted in a "clutch pedal", which used together with the hihat pedal does the same thing as a drop clutch system but has the advantage to free the drummer's hands completly.

 playing techniques 
when struck closed or played with the pedal, the hi-hat gives a short, muted percussive sound.  adjusting the gap between the cymbals can alter the sound of the open hi-hat from a "shimmering", sustained tone to something similar to a ride cymbal. when struck with a drumstick, the cymbals make either a short, snappy sound or a longer sustaining sandy sound depending on the position of the pedal. 

it can be also played just by lifting and lowering the foot to clash the cymbals together, a style commonly used to accent beats 2 and 4 in jazz music. in rock music, the hihats are commonly struck every beat or on beats 1 and 3, while the cymbals are held together. the drummer can control the sound by foot pressure. less pressure allows the cymbals to rub together more freely, giving both greater sustain and greater volume for accent or crescendo. in shuffle time, a rhythm known as "cooking" is often employed. to produce this the cymbals are stuck twice in rapid succession, being held closed on the first stroke and allowed to open just before the second, then allowed to ring before being closed with a "chick" to complete the pattern (the cymbals may or not be struck on the "chick").  

a right-handed drummer will normally play the hi-hat pedal with their left foot, and may additionally use either or both drumsticks. the traditional hi-hat rhythms of rock and jazz were produced by crossing the hands over, so the right stick would play the hi-hat while the left played the snare drum below it, but this is not universal. however, some top modern drummers like billy cobham, carter beauford and simon phillips do not cross their hands over at all, normally playing the hi-hat and also occasionally a second ride cymbal mounted on the left with the left stick rather than the right. this is called open handed playing. in both rock and jazz, often the drummer will move the same stick pattern between the hihat cymbal and the ride cymbal, for example using the hihat in the verses and the ride in the chorus of a song, or using the ride to accompany a lead break or other instrumental solo.

roger taylor drummer for the band queen has many unique ways of using the high-hat  including an involuntary opening of the hi-hat on every backbeat for a rhythm emphasis. and leaving the high-hat slightly open when hitting the snare.
