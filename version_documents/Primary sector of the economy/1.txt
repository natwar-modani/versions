the primary sector of industry generally involves the conversion of natural resources into primary products. most products from this sector are considered raw materials for other industries. major businesses in this sector include agriculture, agribusiness, fishing, forestry and all mining and quarrying industries.

downstream manufacturing industries that aggregate, pack, package, purify or process the raw materials close to the primary producers are normally considered part of this sector, especially if the raw material is unsuitable for sale or difficult to transport long distances.
