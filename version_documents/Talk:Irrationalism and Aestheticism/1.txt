i don't know how to improve this article, but it needs a lot of improvement.  for one thing, it needs a solid historical foundation: who were some irrationalists and aestheticists, and what was the positivist movement they were reacting to?  basically, a list of isms without a statement of what the isms mean is only so much nonsense.  also, consider retitling the article so it is very clear what you're talking about. -- larry sanger

aye, aye captain.  it will require some delving into the old notebooks on my end, which will take some time, but i'll get to it.  although i've studied this stuff, i'm an obvious babe in the world of philosphy.  i do hope to change this.  -- invictus
