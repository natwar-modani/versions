hawaiian is the ancestral language of the indigenous people of the hawaiian islands, the hawaiians, a polynesian people.  hawaiian, along with english, is an official language of the state of hawai'i. it is notable for having a small phoneme inventory (see hawaiian alphabet, below), like many of its polynesian cousins.  especially notable is the fact that it lacks the phoneme /t/, one of only a few languages to lack such a phoneme.

hawaiian is a member of the austronesian language family, related to samoan, maori, fijian, and other languages spoken throughout polynesia, and more distantly to some southeast asian and indian ocean languages.

hawaiian is a endangered language. on most of the islands, hawaiian has been displaced by english and is no longer used as the daily language of communication.  the exception to this is ni'ihau which, because it is a privately owned island and visitation by outsiders strictly controlled, still uses hawaiian in daily communications.  for a variety of reasons starting around 1900, the number of first language speakers of hawaiian was dimished from 37,000 to 1,000; half of these remaining are now in their seventies or eighties (see ethnologue report below for citations).

resistance against the loss of their language by the native peoples of the hawaiian islands has increased in recent decades. hawaiian language "immersion" schools are now open to children whose families want to retain (or reintroduce) hawaiian language back into the next generation.  the local npr station broadcasts a 5-minute daily news summary in hawaiian several times each day, and features a short segment titled "hawaiian word of the day". 

hawaiian pidgin (also known as hawaiian creole) is a local form of english with borrowings from hawaiian and asian languages (predominantly japanese, chinese and tagalog) introduced by immigrants hired to work at sugar and pineapple plantations.
