the hakra is the dried-out channel of a river in pakistan that until about 2000 bc - 1500 bc was the continuation of the ghaggar river in india.

many settlements of the indus valley civilisation have been found along the ghaggar and hakra rivers. 

the saraswati dispute
some archeologists have identified ghaggar hakra river system with the vedic sarasvati river, based the descriptions in vedic texts (e.g. in the enumeration of the rivers in rigveda 10.75.05, the order is ganga, yamuna, sarasvati, sutlej), and other geological and paleobotanical findings. this however, is disputed.
