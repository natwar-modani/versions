hermēs (greek: 'έμης': 'pile of marker stones'), in greek mythology, is the god of travelers, shepherds, land travel, orators, literature, cunning, poets, athletics, weights and measures, and thieves, and the messenger from the gods to humans.  son of zeus and a nymph named maia, hermēs is equivalent to the roman god mercury and the etruscan turms.  hermes was born in a cave on mt. cyllene in peloponnesus, between achaia and arcadia.  his origin on mt. cyllene explains the origin of an epithet for hermēs: hermēs cylleneius.  he was also referred to as enagonios.  as a psychopomp, hermēs is known as psychopompos ("conductor of the soul").  the roman mercury later absorbed the dei lucrii, early gods of commerce and wealth, and were referred to by that name.  hermēs was also later combined with the egyptian anubis to form hermanubis.

the name hermēs trismegistus was used later by alchemists and their like to refer to a mixture-god combining elements from hermēs and the egyptian god thoth.

hermēs or mercury was commonly identified with the germanic god wotan/woden/odin, hence latin dies mercurius corresponds to english wednesday from wodnes dæg 'woden's day'.

the modern post office in greece uses hermēs as its symbol.

 worship 

hermēs was worshipped especially fervently by travelers, pilgrims, thieves and poets.  though temples to hermēs existed throughout greece, arcadia was a center of his cult. the festivals in his honor, called hermoea, were especially prevalent in arcadia.

hermēs was a psychopomp, meaning he brought newly-dead souls to the underworld, hades.  he also brought dreams to living mortals.

in addition to the syrinx and the lyre, hermes invented many types of racing and the entire sport of boxing.  statues of hermēs stood at stadia and gymnasiums throughout greece.

 hermai 

in very ancient greece, before his role as protector of merchants and travelers, hermēs was a phallic god, associated with fertility, luck, roads and borders.  his name comes the word herma referring to a square or rectangular pillar of stone, or bronze; a bust of hermēs' head, usually with a beard, sat on the top of the pillar, and male genitals adorned the base.  the hermai were used to mark roads and borders.  in athens, they were placed outside houses for good luck.  

in 415 bce, when the athenian fleet was about to set sail for syracuse during the peloponnesian war, all of the athenian hermai were vandalized.  the athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from syracuse or anti-war doves from athens itself. socrates' pupil alcibiades was suspected to have been involved, and socrates indirectly paid for the impiety with his life.

 hermes in art 

hermēs was usually portrayed wearing a broad-brimmed or winged cap, winged sandals and his herald's staff, entwined by serpents, the caduceus. he wore the garments of a traveler, worker or shepherd. he was represented by purses, roosters and turtles.

 birth 

hermēs was born on mt. cyllene in arcadia.  the story is told in the hymn to hermes attributed to homer.

 adulthood 

hermēs later invented the flute, which he bartered with apollo for, gaining a golden wand that hermēs used as his staff (see caduceus).

 hermēs' offspring 

 pan 

pan was the son of hermēs and dryope, a human princess.  she was terrified of her ugly, half-goat baby so she ran away.  hermēs took the baby to mt. olympus, where gods enjoyed the child's laughter and good nature.  he became a god worshipped by shepherds and woodsmen particularly.

 abderus 

abderus was a son of hermes who was devoured by the mares of diomedes.  he had gone to the mares with his friend, herakles.

 hermaphroditus 

hermaphroditus was the third son of hermēs, with aphrodite.  he was changed into a hermaphrodite by the gods, responding to the pleas of salmacis, whose love hermaphroditus spurned.

when hermēs loved herse, a jealous aglaulus stood between them and refused to move. hermēs changed her to stone. cephalus was the son of hermes and herse.  hermēs also had a son, ceryx, with herse's other sister, pandrosus.  with aglaulus, hermēs was the father of eumolpus.

 argus/io 

zeus loved the argive princess io and changed her into a cow to protect her from hera. hera suspected his deception and asked for the cow as a present. zeus was unable to refuse and she placed the watchman argus to guard the cow. hermēs, at the request of zeus, lulled argus to sleep and rescued io but hera sent a gadfly to sting her as she wandered the earth in cow form. zeus eventually changed her back to human form, and she became—through epaphus, her son with zeus—the ancestress of herakles.

 other roles 

hermēs saved odysseus from both calypso and circe, by convincing the first to let odysseus go and then protecting him from the latter bestowing upon him an herb that would protect him from circe's spell.  in addition, hermēs brought eurydice back to hades after orpheus looked back towards his wife for a second time.  he also changed the minyades into bats.  he taught the thriae  the arts of fortune-telling and divination.
