for other meanings see hermes (disambiguation)

hermês ("pile of marker stones"), in greek mythology, was the god of travelers, shepherds, land travel, orators, literature, cunning, poets, athletics, weights and measures, and thieves, and the messenger from the gods to humans.  son of zeus and a nymph named maia, hermes was equivalent to the roman god mercury and the etruscan turms.  hermes was born in a cave on mt. cyllene in peloponnesus, between achaia and arcadia.  his origin on mt. cyllene explains the origin of an epithet for hermes: hermes cylleneius.  he was also referred to as enagonios.  as a psychopomp, hermes was known as psychopompos ("conductor of the soul").  the roman mercury later absorbed the dei lucrii, early gods of commerce and wealth, and were referred to by that name.  hermes was also later combined with the egyptian anubis to form hermanubis.

obviously the name hermes trismegistus was used later by alchemists and their like to refer to a mixture-god combining elements from hermes and the egyptian god thoth.

in 415 bce, when the athenian fleet was about to set sail for syracuse during the peloponnesian war, all of the athenian hermai were vandalized.  though it was never proven, the athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from syracuse or anti-war doves from athens itself.
