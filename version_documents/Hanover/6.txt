hanover (german: hannover () []), on the river leine, is the capital of the federal state of lower saxony (niedersachsen), germany. with a population of over 500,000 (in 2005) it is a major center of northern germany, known for hosting annual commercial expositions such as the hanover fair and the cebit. in 2000, hanover hosted the world fair expo 2000. the hanover fairground, due to numerous extensions especially for the expo 2000, is the largest in the world. hanover also has regional importance because of its university and medical school, its international airport and its large zoo (hanover zoo).

history
the town was founded in medieval times on the bank of the river leine (the original name honovere may be translated as "high bank", though it is debated). it was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen, which became a comparatively large town in the 13th century. in the 14th century the main churches of hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three town gates to secure the city.

in 1636 the duke of calenberg decided to move his residence to hanover. his duchy was afterwards known as the duchy of hanover (see: house of hanover). his descendants would later become kings of great britain (after 1800, kings of the united kingdom); the first of them was george i, who ascended to the british throne in 1714. three kings of great britain or the united kingdom were at the same time electoral princes of hanover.

during the seven years' war on july 26, 1757 the battle of hastenbeck took place. the french army defeated the hanoverian army of observation, leading to the occupation of hanover.

after napoleon imposed the convention of artlenburg (convention of the elbe) on july 5, 1803 about 30,000 french soldiers occupied hanover. the convention also meant the disbanding of the army of hanover. george iii did not recognize the convention of the elbe and made an effort to recruit foreign troops. as a result a great number of soldiers of hanover eventually emigrated to england leading to the king's german legion which later played an important role in the battle of waterloo. at the congress of vienna in 1814 george iii elevated the electorate to the kingdom of hanover. the capital town hanover expanded to the western bank of the leine and grew considerably ever since.

in 1837 the personal union of the united kingdom and hanover ended as william iv's heir in the united kingdom was female (queen victoria), and hanover could be inherited only by males. hanover passed to william iv's brother,  ernest augustus, and continued as a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by prussia. after the annexation, the people of hanover opposed the prussian regime. nevertheless, the growth of hanover continued until world war ii, when two thirds of the town was bombed to ruins. after the war, hanover was in the british zone of occupation of germany, and became part of the new state (land) of lower saxony in 1946.

administrative divisions
in addition to being capital of lower saxony, hanover was also the capital of the administrative area hanover region (regierungsbezirk hannover) until lower saxony's regions were disbanded at the beginning of 2005. it is, however, still part of the hanover district (region hannover), which is a municipal body made up from the former district and city of hanover.
