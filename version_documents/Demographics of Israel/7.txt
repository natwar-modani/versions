jews

among jews, 68% were sabras (israeli-born), mostly second or third generation israelis, and the rest are olim — 22% from europe and the americas, and 10% from asia and africa, including the arab countries.

traditionally, jews are grouped into:
ashkenazim - jews whose ancestors came from germany, france, and eastern europe. most ashkenazi jews that settled in israel were from russia, poland, romania, hungary, italy (mainly milan and trieste), north america, south africa and australia.
sephardim - jews whose ancestors lived in spain and portugal until 1492, and sometimes until later, then spread to greece, italy, england, the netherlands and elsewhere in europe, as well as into the ottoman empire. many sephardi jews that settled in israel from morocco, turkey, north africa and the mediterranean area are descendants from migrants from spain and portugal. in modern israeli hebrew usage, this category often includes mizrahim.
bené roma - jews whose ancestors lived mainly in central italy. due to its history and geographical position, rome hosted the most ancient continuous jewish community in western europe, dating back to the roman empire. northern italy hosted for centuries large sephardic and ashkenazic communities.
mizrahim - jews whose ancestors lived in arab or muslim lands, but did not live in spain or portugal. most jewish immigrants to israel from iran, iraq, yemen, and syria are considered mizrahim.
beta israel of ethiopia who were initially brought to israel during operation solomon and operation moses today 100,000 live in the country.
indian jews - jews from five distinct communities in india and also burma, each with very different origins.
note: the greek are romaniotes; and many of the bulgarian and latin american are sephardic. these groups claim distinct cultures and histories.

those with origins in muslim and arab lands are commonly called sephardi by their ashkenazi counterparts, though the majority does not descend from iberian jews and are best described as mizrahi. the jews of iran and iraq are always called mizrahi and the yemenite and omani are temani or also mizrahi.                

for a complete list and thorough discussion of jewish ethnic groups, see jewish ethnic divisions. however, this grouping is becoming used less due to cultural assimilation and intermarriage.

in israel there are approximately 300,000 ethnic jews who are not jewish according to the halachic law. of this number approximately 10% are christian and 89% are either jewish or non-religious. only a small number of them (c.2,000) convert every year to judaism, while immigration from fsu adds thousands to their number every year. the total number of conversions under the nativ program of idf was 640 in 2005 and 450 in 2006. from 2002 to 2007 october 1, a total of 2,213 soldiers have converted under nativ.  in 2003, 437 christians converted to judaism, in 2004 – 884, and in 2005 – 733. 

arabs

arabs in israel include descendants of those who remained within israel borders during the 1948 arab-israeli war or returned soon afterwards, palestinians who immigrated to israel (especially since 1993) as well as druze and bedouins. about 9% of israeli arabs are christians of various denominations, mostly catholics and orthodox.

circassians
in israel, there are also a few thousand circassians, living mostly in kfar kama (2,000) and reyhaniye (1,000). these two villages were a part of a greater group of circassian villages around the golan heights. the circassians in israel enjoy, like druzes, a status aparte. male circassians (at their leader's request) are mandated for military service, while females are not.

official figures do not exist as to the number of atheists or otherwise non-affiliated individuals, who may comprise up to a quarter of the population referred to as jewish. according to a 2004 israel central bureau of statistics study on israelis aged over  8% of israeli jews define themselves as haredim (or ultra-orthodox); an additional 9% are "religious" (predominantly orthodox, also known in israel as: zionist-religious, national-religious and kippot srugot); 12% consider themselves "religious-traditionalists" (mostly adhering to jewish halakha); 27% are "non-religious traditionalists" (only partly respecting the jewish halakha), and 43% are "secular". among the seculars, 53% say they believe in god. due to the higher natality rate of religious and traditionalists over seculars, the share of religious and traditionalists among the overall population is even higher.

languages
due to its immigrant nature, israel is one of the most multicultural and multilinguistic societies in the world. hebrew and arabic are the official languages, while english, russian, yiddish, romanian, ukrainian, amharic, french, spanish, german, vietnamese, and polish are the most commonly used foreign languages. a certain degree of english is spoken virtually universally, and is the language of choice for many israeli businesses. courses on english language is mandatory in the israeli school system, and most schools offer arabic, spanish and french.
