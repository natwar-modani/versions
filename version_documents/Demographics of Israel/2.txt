jews

see also: jewish ethnic divisions

among jews, 68% were sabras (israeli-born), mostly second or third generation israelis, and the rest are olim — 22% from europe and the americas, and 10% from asia and africa, including the arab countries.

traditionally, jews are grouped into:
 ashkenazim - jews whose ancestors came from germany, france, and eastern europe. most ashkenazi jews that settled in israel were from russia, poland, romania, hungary, italy (mainly milan and trieste), north america, south africa and australia..
 sephardim - jews whose ancestors lived in spain and portugal until 1492, then spread to greece, italy, the netherlands, england and elsewhere in europe. most sephardi jews that settled in israel were from also from morocco, turkey, and many from other north african and mediterranean area. in modern israeli hebrew usage, this category often includes mizrahim (see next group).
 bené roma - jews whose ancestors lived mainly in central italy. due to its history and geographical position, rome hosted the most ancient jewish community in europe, dating back to the roman empire. northern italy hosted for centuries large sephardic and ashkenazic communities.
 mizrahim - jews whose ancestors lived in arab or muslim lands, but did not live in spain or portugal. most jewish immigrants to israel from iran, iraq, yemen, and syria are considered mizrahim.

note: in israel, jews with origins in western (christian) countries are called ashkenazi though many are not: the georgian are gruzinim or qartveli ebraeli; the greek are romaniotes; and many of the bulgarian and latin american are sephardic. these groups claim distinct cultures and histories.

those with origins in muslim and arab lands are commonly called sephardi though many are not.  the jews of iran and iraq are mizrahi and the yemenite and omani are temani.                
none of these groups include the beta israel of ethiopia who were brought to israel during operation solomon and operation moses, as well as other groups.

however, this grouping is becoming used less due to cultural assimilation and intermarriage.

 arabs 

arabs in israel include descendants of palestinians who remained within israel borders during the 1948 arab-israeli war, as well as druze and bedouins. about 9% of israeli arabs are christian. 

religions

according to israel's central bureau of statistics, at the end of 2004, 76.2% of israelis were jews by religion. muslims made up 16.1% of israelis, 2.1% were christian, 1.6% were druze and the remaining 3.9% (including russian immigrants and some jews) were not classified by religion.

official figures do not exist as to the number of atheists or otherwise non-affiliated individuals, who may comprise up to a quarter of the population referred to as jewish. according to one study, 6% of israeli jews define themselves as haredim (or ultra-orthodox); an additional 9% are "religious" (predominantly orthodox, also known in israel as: zionist-religious, national-religious and kepot srogot); 34% consider themselves "traditionalists" (not strictly adhering to jewish halakha); and 51% are "secular". among the seculars, 53% say they believe in god(s). 

however, an alternative study by 'the economist' came up with very different statistics, maintaining that 83.5% of israelis practice judaism. more than 31.3% of those believe that israel was god's gift to a chosen people.
