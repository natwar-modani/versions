according to israel's central bureau of statistics, at the end of 2004, of israel's 6.9 million people, 76.2% were jews, 19.5%  arabs, and 4.3% "others".

among jews, 68% were sabras (israeli-born), mostly second or third generation israelis, and the rest are olim — 22% from europe and the americas, and 10% from asia and africa, including the arab countries.

among jews, 63% are israeli-born. 27% are immigrants from the west, and 11% are immigrants from developing countries in asia and africa, including arab countries and ethiopia: see ethiopian jews. 

traditionally, jews are grouped into:
 ashkenazim - jews whose ancestors lived in from germany, france, and eastern europe. most jewish immigrants to israel from  russia, poland, romania, hungary, north america, south africa and australia are ashkenazim.
 sephardim - jews whose ancestors lived in spain and portugal. most jewish immigrants to israel from morocco, turkey, and many from other north african and mediterranean areas are sephardim. in modern israeli hebrew usage, this category often includes mizrahim (see next group).
 mizrahim - jews whose ancestors lived in arab or muslim lands, but did not live in spain or portugal. most jewish immigrants to israel from iran, iraq, yemen, and syria are considered mizrahim.

note: in israel, jews with origins in western (christian) countries are called ashkenazi though many are not.  the jews of italy are bené roma; the georgian are gruzim; the greek are romaniotes; and many of the bulgarian and latin american are sephardic. these groups claim distinct cultures and histories.

those with origins in muslim and arab lands are commonly called sephardi though many are not.  the jews of iran and iraq are mizrahi and the yemenite and omani are temani.                
none of these groups include the beta israel of ethiopia who were brought to israel during operation solomon and operation moses, as well as other groups.

for a complete list and thorough discussion of jewish ethnic groups, see jewish ethnic divisions.

however, this grouping is becoming used less due to cultural assimilation and intermarriage.

religions
according to israel's central bureau of statistics, at the end of 2004, 76.2% of israelis were jews by religion. israel, however, is not a theocracy and other religions are respected. muslims made up 16.1% of israelis, 2.1% were christian, 1.6% were druze and the remaining 3.9% (including russian immigrants and some jews) were not classified by religion.

official figures do not exist as to the number of atheists or otherwise non-affiliated individuals, who may comprise up to a quarter of the population referred to as jewish. according to one study, 6% of israeli jews define themselves as haredim (or ultra-orthodox); an additional 9% are "religious" (predominantly orthodox, also known in israel as: zionist-religious, national-religious and kepot srogot); 34% consider themselves "traditionalists" (not strictly adhering to jewish halacha); and 51% are "secular". among the seculars, 53% say they believe in god.
