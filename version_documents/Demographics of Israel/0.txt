jewish: 80.9%, arab: 19.1%  (end of 2002). 

note: the figure for "jewish" includes people which are not classified as "jewish" by religion. these are mainly immigrants from the former ussr which are either christian or of unclassified religion.

among jews, 63% are israeli-born. 27% are immigrants from the west, and 10% are immigrants from developing countries in asia and africa, including arab countries. 

traditionally, jews are grouped into:
 ashkenazim - jews whose ancestors lived in germany and eastern-europe.  most immigrants to israel from north and south america, russian, south africa and australia are ashkenazim.
 sephardim- jews whose ancestors lived in spain, portugal, and north africa. this category also includes near-eastern or oriental jews, people who descend from ancient jewish communities in islamic lands.
 yemenite jews - jews whose ancestors lived in yemen.
however, this grouping is becoming less and less accurate due to cultural assimilation and intermarriage.

jewish 76.8%, muslim 15.7% (mostly sunni), christian 2.1%, druze 1.6%, other 3.7% (end of 2002). 

official figures do not exist as to the number of atheists or otherwise non-affiliated individuals, who may comprise up to a quarter of the population referred to as jewish. according to one study, 6% of israeli jews define themselves as haredim (ultra-orthodox); an additional 9% are "religious" (orthodox); 34% consider themselves "traditionalists" (not strictly adhering to jewish halacha); and 51% are "secular". among the seculars, 53% say they believe in god.
