what's meant by an "eager" variation?  i worked with functional languages for some amount of time and never heard the term. --robert merkel

i'm pretty sure it means "without lazy evaluation".

that's right -- the anome

haskell is, as of 2002, the functional language on which the most research is being performed.

do you have a reference for this statement ? --taw

"haskell" can also refer to http://www.haskell.edu/ , so i'm not moving this page to haskell. --eloquence 16:55 jan 24, 2003 (utc)

not sure about the new version of the fibonacci sequence example â€” it's longer than the first one and harder to read imho (although it is clever, i admit). any comments on this? cadr

which one? -- taku 16:14, apr 6, 2004 (utc)

 the one using zipwith -- cadr

i see this change:
fibs = 0 : 1 : (zipwith (+) fibs (tail fibs))
to
fibs@(_:rest) = 0 : 1 : (zipwith (+) fibs rest)

-- taku 16:36, apr 6, 2004 (utc)

yes, that's the one i meant, thanks. -- cadr

i got the idea: can we present both versions on the article and discuss how they work. to be honest, i don't know how the second one works and i want to know why you said it's a clever way. the readers might be facinated by the fact haskell is so cool. -- taku 16:52, apr 6, 2004 (utc)

should this article mention hindley-milner type inference and the monomorphism restriction? or is this to detailed information to be included into a encyclopedic article? -- tobias bergemann 08:30, 2004 nov 16 (utc)
