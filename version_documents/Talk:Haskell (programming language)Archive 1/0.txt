what's meant by an "eager" variation?  i worked with functional languages for some amount of time and never heard the term. --robert merkel

i'm pretty sure it means "without lazy evaluation".

that's right -- the anome

haskell is, as of 2002, the functional language on which the most research is being performed.

do you have a reference for this statement ? --taw

"haskell" can also refer to http://www.haskell.edu/ , so i'm not moving this page to haskell. --eloquence 16:55 jan 24, 2003 (utc)
