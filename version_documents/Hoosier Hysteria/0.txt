hoosier hysteria is the state of excitment surrounding the state high school basketball tournament in indiana.  to some degree this excitement can be understood by watching the movie hoosiers.  in part the excitment stemmed from the inclusion of all indiana high schools in the same tournament, where a small town's david might knock off a large city's goliath.  the state's recent move to a class system for their basketball championship may diminish the phenomenon.

however hoosiers have a traditional love for high school basketball equalled only by texans' love for high school football and minnesotans' love for high school hockey.  it is one of the state's cherished traditions.

historically, indiana had small towns, each with its own small school system.  because indiana high schools had fewer students than most, basketball was a natural game, since it only required five starters and a few reserves.  even one or two great basketball players can make a high school team a powerhouse, and nearly every indiana town dreams of such glory.
