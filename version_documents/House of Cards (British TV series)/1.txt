house of cards was a highly political television drama serial, made by the bbc, which ran in 1990 at the end of margaret thatcher's tenure as british prime minister. 

the story was adapted by andrew davies from a novel by michael dobbs. in it, the fictional chief whip, francis urquhart (the initials, "f.u.", were deliberately chosen), played by ian richardson, is seen engaging in all the skullduggery of power politics, including murder, in his efforts to become prime minister. susannah harker plays mattie storin, the journalist who tries to uncover his misdeeds.

there were two sequels: to play the king in 1994 (with the king, resembling charles, prince of wales, played by michael kitchen) and the final cut in 1995.  it has been said that richardson agreed to appear in a third series only on the understanding that the character got his come-uppance.

frequently during the drama urquhart talks through the camera to the audience, breaking the 'fourth wall'. the drama also introduced the phrase "you might say that, i couldn't possibly comment" which was frequently used by urquhart whenever he didn't want to give an actual answer to a question put to him.

the ending of the television version is different to the book: the book allowed no possibility for sequels as francis urquhart either jumps or is pushed from the roof of the palace of westminster.  in the television version, he instead pushed mattie storin off.
