the cotw vote was quite specifically and intentionally for history of science; information should of course be drawn from history of science and technology.--pharos 07:55, 21 feb 2005 (utc)
please note that history of science and technology actually contains much information that should properly be here.--pharos 09:23, 21 feb 2005 (utc)

we evidently need more content. however, i'm not very happy with the "modern science" heading, since mathematics is not a mondern science, and all of the different sciences have evolved during this history. could we just take out the "biology, physics etc" sections? ✏ sverdrup 13:41, 21 feb 2005 (utc)

should that be replaced with individual sections throughout the article that briefly summarize the development of that branch within that period or region? --brian0918 13:57, 21 feb 2005 (utc)

 illustrations 

since this article is exclusively about science, instead of technology, an image of an abacus does not seem appropriate. how about an early greek natural philosopher instead? — rjh 17:09, 21 feb 2005 (utc)

 science, technology, and their relationship 

where does the boundary between science and technology exist? when i think of prehistory of science i think the wheel and fire - but also consider these to be technologies? --oldak quill 20:27, 21 feb 2005 (utc)

i'd say science deals more with the theoretical, and technology is the application of these theories.  the thing with prehistory is that our only evidence is their "technology", so in that case it would be alright to focus on that, but for the most part i think the article should deal with the concepts and those who developed them.  if developments occurred as a result of experiments rather than theory, that is alright as well. --brian0918 20:50, 21 feb 2005 (utc)
technology is applied science. thus, without science, no technology, but science without technological application is possible. still: do we really need this article *and* history of science and technology? i think they should be merged. dab <small>(ᛏ</small>) 20:56, 21 feb 2005 (utc)
rather, should history of science and technology be split? though science and technology are practically indivisable in prehistory (due to a lack of scientific records) - they become very different things upon the dawn of written records. much of the understanding of the cosmos and the atom has little to do with technology, for example. --oldak quill 21:16, 21 feb 2005 (utc)
the phrase "science and technology" could just be interpreted as something different, ie "the history of the interaction of science with technology, and the history of resulting technologies"... if that makes any sense. --brian0918 21:26, 21 feb 2005 (utc)

my idea when i put this up on cotw was that history of science and technology should compare the histories of technology and science, and cover the academic field hst. there is significant overlap between the histories science and technology, but they are quite separate things. it is not true at all that technology is applied science. technology is far older than science, and until recently (19th or 20th century?), virtually all technology was the product of practical knowledge, not scientific knowledge. the distinction is still important. fredrik | talk 23:27, 22 feb 2005 (utc)

 ancient civilisations 

the four suggested ancient civilisations (i added egypt, making 5) do not nearly cover all ancient civilisations and their sciences. currently missing are the minoan and mycenaean civilizations (although we could classify this as græco-rome), southeast asian civilisation, mesoamerica, andean, japanese, chibchan, etc. --oldak quill 01:12, 23 feb 2005 (utc)
 i just wrote the four as they are the four important ancient civilizations, as far as i knew. feel free to add more as i must have definetly missed a few. kaal 03:14, 23 feb 2005 (utc)

 notes 

is anyone else wondering if that angelfire reference is legitimate? pages like that tend to be either blatently plageuristic or original work, plus they are certainly not guaranteed to be accurate. any better sources? --dmcdevit 05:21, 23 feb 2005 (utc)
