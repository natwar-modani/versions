twelve ships of the royal navy have borne the name hms resolution:

 the first resolution was the tredagh, launched in 1653, of 66 cannon, renamed resolution in 1660 and destroyed after grounding by a dutch fireship in the st james's day battle on 4 august 1666. john tyrrell was lieutenant on the ship in 1665.
 the second resolution was a 70-gun third-rate launched in 1667, rebuilt 1698, and foundered in 1703.
 the third resolution was a 70-gun third-rate launched in 1705 but run ashore to avoid capture in 1707.
 the fourth resolution was a 70-gun third-rate launched in 1708 and wrecked 1711.
 the fifth resolution was a 74-gun third-rate launched in 1758 but run aground and lost a year later at the battle of quiberon bay.
 the sixth resolution was a 74-gun third-rate launched in 1770 and broken up in 1813.
 the seventh resolution was the vessel of captain james cook in his explorations.
 the eighth resolution was a cutter purchased in 1779 and foundered 1797.
 the ninth resolution was a battleship in service from 1892 to 1914.
 the tenth resolution was a battleship in service from 1915 to 1944.
 the eleventh resolution (s22) was the lead ship of the resolution-class ballistic missile submarines.

the very first warship however to bear the name resolution — though not hms resolution — was the hms prince royal that was renamed resolution during the commonwealth period.
