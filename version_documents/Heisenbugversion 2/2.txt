a term used in software programming to describe a bug that disappears or alters its characteristics when it is researched. a common example are bugs that occur in a release-mode compile of a program but do not occur when researched under debug-mode, or some bugs caused by a race condition. the name is a pun on the physics term "heisenberg uncertainty principle", which is popularly believed to refer to the way observers affect the observed in quantum mechanics.
