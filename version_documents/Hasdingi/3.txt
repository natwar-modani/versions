the hasdingi were the southern tribes of the vandals, an east germanic tribe.  they lived in areas of today's southern poland, western ukraine, slovakia and hungary. they participated in the migratory movements of the vandals into the iberian peninsula, and subsequently to north africa.

the hasdingi crossed the rhine into gaul in 406 ad, although their king godigisel lost his life in battle against the franks during the crossing. the hasdingi settled as foederati in gallaecia (today galicia, asturias and the north of portugal) along with the suebi in 409 ad and their kingdom was one of the earliest barbarian territories to be founded after the fall of the western roman empire.

gunderic, godegisel's successor as king of the hasdingi, lost his kingdom to king hermeric of the suebi in 419 after the battle of the nervasos mountains where the vandals were overwhelmed by an allied force of suebi and romans. he fled to baetica with his army where he became king of the silingi vandals and of the alans. gunderic was succeeded by his brother genseric in 428 ad, who subsequently fled from iberia to north africa where he established a kingdom at carthage.
