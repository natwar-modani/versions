the hasdingi were the southern tribes of the vandals, an east germanic tribe.  they lived in areas of today's southern poland, western ukraine, slovakia and hungary. they were part of the migratory movements of the vandals, into the iberian peninsula and later on to north africa.

in 409 they settled as foederati in gallaecia (today galicia, asturias and the north of portugal).

gunderic, king of the hasdingi, lost his kingdom to king hermeric of the suebi after a battle against an allied force of suebi and romans. he fled to baetica with his army where he became king of the silingi vandals and of the alans.
