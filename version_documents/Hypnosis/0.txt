the american psychological association division of psychological hypnosis begins its definition of hypnosis "a procedure during which a health professional or researcher suggests that a client, patient, or subject experience changes in sensations, perceptions, thoughts, or behavior." any definition is necessarily vague, as the underlying mechanism is little understood. some theories view hypnosis as an altered state of consciousness, others as a type of focused attention. 

scientists first became involved in hypnosis around 1770, when dr franz mesmer started investigating an effect he called 'animal magnetism' or 'mesmerism' (the latter name still remaining popular today.) hypnosis has been used with variable success for hundreds of applications, including entertainment, pain-relief and psychoanalysis. generally, under hypnosis people become more susceptible to suggestion, causing changes in the way they feel, think, and behave, although contrary to popular belief they do still remain in control of their actions. hypnosis also generally stimulates a feeling of relaxation, and this has helped the development of it in to a therapy--hypnotherapy--although some of the treatments practiced, such as regression, are viewed by some with scepticism.

hypnosis is usually brought on by a hypnotist carrying out an induction procedure. different people respond more or less successfuly to suggestion. some people actually do seem able to display 'enhanced functioning', such the suppression of pain, under hypnosis. however studies suggest that these qualities are not exclusive to hypnosis, and it is the drama and fantasizing that encourages the behaviour.
