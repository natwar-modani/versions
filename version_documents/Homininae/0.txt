homininae is a subfamily of hominidae, including homo sapiens and some extinct relatives, but excluding all living relatives such as the chimpanzee. it comprises all those hominids, such as australopithecus, that arose after the split from the other (still living) apes.

originally the term 'hominidae' was itself used in this sense, human or humanoid as opposed to ape. but it is now recognized that humans and the great apes are so close that they belong in the same family. in the linnaean taxonomy, 'hominidae' has date priority over 'pongidae', the great ape family, and so 'pongidae' is not used.
