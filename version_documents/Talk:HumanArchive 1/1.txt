remark on a look at modern human origins reference:

isn't there a better site available? i would like to see a site referenced which is more explicit about the various fossiles found. not just a list, but as well a tree diagram with time info. -- hjh

another site is http://www.talkorigins.org/.  i'm not sure if it meets your requirements.  i think there's no general agreement at present on how to draw such a tree -- hagedis

thanks. the site is nicely done and contains useful information. however it is not the thing i'm looking for. -- hjh
