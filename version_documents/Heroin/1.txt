heroin or diacetylmorphine (c21h23no5) is a white crystalline alkaloid opiate, prepared from morphine by acetylation.

it was invented in 1895 by heinrich dreser, working for the bayer company of elberfeld, germany, developed as a drug without the common morphine side effects.  bayer promptly began production of diacetylmorphine under the trademark "heroin" and sold it as cough medicine.

as a medicine, heroin is administered usually in the form of its hydrochloride as a hypnotic and analgesic.

it is also illictly used as a powerful and addictive drug producing intense euphoric sensations. it is highly addictive. those who have no desire to quit, might as well be circling the drain.

methadone is another drug often used to substitute for heroin in treatment for heroin addiction.  methadone is just as addicting as herion and should not be a substitute.  the best way to quit is cold turkey if at all possible.

 short and long term effects of heroin include: 
 mental confusion
 euphoria
 slow and shallow respiration
 nausea and vomiting
 spontaneous abortion

 withdrawal symptoms 
the withdrawal syndrome from heroin begins within 12 hours of discontinuation of the drug: sweating, malaise, anxiety, depression, general feeling of heaviness, cramp-like pains in the limbs, yawning and lachrymation, sleep difficulties, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, cramps and fever occur.  most addicts also complain of "itchy blood", which is very painful.

you can tell a person is on heroin by the pinpoint eyes and the constant nodding off.  a person will nod off even while he is eating and end up with face in mash potatoes.  he will not care about his appearance and will smell bad.  also, a heroin addict will do anything to support his habit, even steal from his own mother.  to sum it all up, heroin is a bad drug and should not be messed with.
