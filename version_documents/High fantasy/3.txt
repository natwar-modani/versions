high fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy fiction that is set in invented or parallel worlds.  built upon the platform of a diverse body of works in the already very popular fantasy genre, high fantasy came into fruition through the work of authors such as c. s. lewis and, foremost, j. r. r. tolkien, whose major fantasy works were published in the 1950s.  while it is far from being the oldest fantasy subgenre, high fantasy, along with sword and sorcery, has become one of the two genres most commonly associated with the general term fantasy.

 genre overview 
these stories are generally serious in tone and often epic in scope, dealing with themes of grand struggle against supernatural, evil forces. it is one of the most popular subgenres of fantasy fiction. some typical characteristics of high fantasy include fantastical elements such as elves and dwarves, magic, wizards, invented languages, quests, coming-of-age themes, and multi-volume narratives.

the term can also distinguish between high fantasy and low fantasy—or to be more precise, low fantasy can be contrasted with high fantasy, as the term "low fantasy" has been defined in varying ways that contradict each other—but all contrast with high fantasy.  in the commonest, "low fantasy" is distinguished by the relative amount of supernatural forces in the world—low—or by its setting in the real world with fantastical elements intruding. 

in some fiction, a contemporary, "real-world" character is placed in the invented world, sometimes through devices such as portals to other worlds or even subconscious travels. purists might not consider this to be "true" high fantasy, although such stories are often categorized as high fantasy due to the fact that they've yet to be classified as their own distinct subgenre, and often resemble this subgenre more closely than any other.

high fantasy worlds may be more or less closely based on real world milieus, or on legends such as arthurian.  when the resemblance is strong, particularly when real-world history is used, high fantasy shades into alternate history.

when the scope is less than epic, dealing with the hero's personal fight for personal stakes against evil forces, the epic fantasy may shade into sword and sorcery.

high fantasy is the most popular and successful subgenre of the fantasy fiction. its fandom ranges from tolkien to contemporary. recent screen versions of tolkiens's the lord of the rings and lewis' the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe have contributed to the subgenre's continuing popularity. moreover some novels are in preproduction status for movie adaptations like david farland's the runelords and terry brooks' magic kingdom of landover.

 concepts 
most high fantasy storylines are told from the viewpoint of one main hero. often, much of the plot revolves around his heritage or mysterious nature. in many novels the hero is an orphan or unusual sibling, often with some incredible ability or abilities and skills in a particular area (usually either magic or skill with a weapon).  some examples of this are lloyd alexander's taran, assistant pig-keeper, terry goodkind's richard rahl, nathan pyles' aemyn of quelvyn's rede, robert jordan's rand al'thor of the wheel of time, raymond feist's pug of riftwar saga, david eddings' belgarion of belgariad, tad williams' simon of memory, sorrow, and thorn. in other works he is a completely developed individual with his own character and spirit — david eddings' sparhawk of the elenium and the tamuli. 

in the beginning of the storyline, the hero is threatened by the unknown force. one reason for such a threat is that, unlike the typical sword and sorcery adventurer, the hero is seldom bored stiff by ordinary life and therefore will not abandon it quickly and on any excuse.  while, like bilbo baggins, he may be eager for adventure, he is also usually capable of appreciating the quotidian.  by the same token, the hero of the high fantasy adventure is capable of completing it and settling down to ordinary life again.

typically, the hero slowly gains knowledge of his past through legend, prophecy, lost-and-found-again family members, or encounters with "mentor" characters who know more about him than he does. with that knowledge comes power and self-confidence; the hero often begins as a childlike figure, but matures rapidly, experiencing a huge gain in fighting/problem-solving abilities along the way. in many books there is a knowing, mystical teacher, often a formidable wizard or warrior, who provides the main character with advice and help. examples would be: the wizard kulgan of riftwar saga, tolkien's gandalf, eddings' belgarath, jordan's moiraine, goodkind's zeddicus zu'l zorander, and allanon of terry brooks.  the plot of the story often depicts the hero's fight against the evil forces as a bildungsroman.

these concepts have become so well-known amongst fantasists over the years that danny birt jokingly wrote them up in the form of a math equation in the author's note of his epic fantasy book ending an ending.  the author's note went on to say that the book was written in direct opposition of expected fantasy concepts.  whether the rest of his pentology will continue in this vein remains to be seen.

recycling of ideas sometimes makes high fantasy dull or repetitive. many of the novels are strongly influenced by tolkien's the lord of the rings, which is considered the groundwork of the genre. others lift generously from real-life myths and legends, which can also result in a very familiar feel.

 saga or series 
role-playing campaign settings like forgotten realms by ed greenwood or r. a. salvatore and dragonlance by tracy hickman and margaret weis' are a common basis for many fantasy books and many other authors continue to contribute to the settings.

from tolkien to the modern day, authors in this genre tend to create their own worlds where they set multi-tiered narratives such as the belgariad, malloreon and memory, sorrow, and thorn. other authors such as george r.r. martin, robert jordan, r. scott bakker, steven erikson, l. e. modesitt, jr., and terry goodkind write extended stories over several volumes relating with the same character threads.

publishers
there are several publishing companies that are devoted entirely to publishing fantasy literature (or fantasy and science fiction).  daw books was one of the first such publishers established, and others include avari press, baen books, roc, tor books, and del rey books.
