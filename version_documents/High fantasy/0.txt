high fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy fiction that is set in invented or parallel worlds. these stories are serious in tone, often epic in scope, dealing with themes of grand struggle against supernatural evil forces.

other typical characteristics of high fantasy include fantastical races (such as elves), magic, wizards, invented languages, coming-of-age themes, and multi-volume narratives.

in some high fantasy, a contemporary, "real-world" character is placed in the invented world. purists might not consider this to be "true" high fantasy.

some of the most famous examples include:

j. r. r. tolkien's middle earth
ursula k. le guin's earthsea
lord dunsany's elfland
