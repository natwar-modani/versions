homeostasis is the regulation of a system's internal environment to maintain a stable state. the term is most often used to refer to biological homeostasis in humans and animals, but can apply to any system.

biological homeostasis

their are principally 6 substances that the body has to control:

 carbon dioxide
 urea
 water
 sugar
 various ions
 oxygen

this control is achieved by the use of various organs and glands in the body.

the hypothalamus monitors water-contents, carbon dioxide concentration and blood temperature, sending nerve impulses to the pituitary gland and skin.

the pituitary gland makes adh (anti-diuretic hormone) to control water content in the body.

the muscles can shiver to produce heat if body temperature is too low. 

the pancreas produces insulin to control blood-sugar concentration.

the lungs take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide.

the kidneys remove urea and adjust ion and water concentration.

additionally, warm-blooded animals (homeotherms) maintain their internal temperature through a process of homeostasis.
