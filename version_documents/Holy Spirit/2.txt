while the more general term spirit of god has been used in diverse religions from hinduism to taoism, the term holy spirit specifically refers to the beliefs held in the abrahamic religions.

for the majority of christians, the belief in the holy trinity implies the existence of three distinct holy persons: god the father, god the son and god the holy spirit being one eternal triune god. this doctrine and designation, however, are not shared by all christians denominations, or the other abrahamic religions.systematic theology by lewis sperry chafer 1993 isbn 0825423406 page 25the wiersbe bible commentary: the complete new testament by warren w. wiersbe 2007 isbn 9780781445399 page 471

christianity

for the majority of christians the holy spirit (prior english language usage: the holy ghost (from old english gast, “spirit”) is the third person of the holy trinity—father, son, and holy spirit, and is almighty god. the holy spirit is seen by mainstream trinitarian christians as one person of the triune god, who revealed his holy name yhwh to his people israel, sent his eternally begotten son jesus to save them, and sent the holy spirit to sanctify and give life to his church. the triune god manifests as three persons, or in the greek hypostases,see discussion in  one being.grudem, wayne a. 1994. systematic theology: an introduction to biblical doctrine. leicester, england: inter-varsity press; grand rapids, mi: zondervan. page 226.

judaism

the term "holy spirit" only occurs three times in the hebrew bible. (found once in psalm 51:11 and twice in isaiah 63:10,11) although, the term "spirit" in the hebrew scriptures, in reference to the "god's spirit", does occur more times.  in judaism, god is one, the idea of god as a duality or trinity among gentiles may be shituf (or "not purely monotheistic"). the term ruach hakodesh (holy spirit) is found frequently in talmudic and midrashic literature. in some cases it signifies prophetic inspiration, while in others it is used as a hypostatization or a metonym for god.alan unterman and rivka horowitz,ruah ha-kodesh, encyclopedia judaica (cd-rom edition, jerusalem: judaica multimedia/keter, 1997). the rabbinic “holy spirit,” has a certain degree of personification, but it remains, “a quality belonging to god, one of his attributes” and not, as in mainstream christianity, representative of “any metaphysical divisions in the godhead.”joseph abelson,the immanence of god in rabbinical literature (london:macmillan and co., 1912).

in judaism, the references to the spirit of god, ruach hakodesh, the holy spirit of yhwh, abound, however it has rejected any idea of the eternal god as being either dual or triune.

islam

in islam, the holy spirit (arabic: الروح القدس  al-ruh al-qudus, "the-spirit the-holy") is mentioned several times in the qur'an, where it acts as an agent of divine action or communication. in hadith it is commonly identified with the angel gabriel (arabic jibreel). the spirit (الروح al-ruq, without the adjective "holy") is also used as the creative spirit from god by which god enlivened adam, and inspired the angels and the prophets. the belief in trinity is explicitly forbidden by the qur'an and called a grave sin. the same applies to any idea of the duality of god (allah).griffith, sidney h. holy spirit, encyclopaedia of the quran.patrick hughes, thomas patrick hughes, a dictionary of islam, p. 605. though grammatical gender has no bearing on actual gender in non-personal nouns, the term holy spirit translates in and is used in the masculine form in all the quran. in arabic language the word "holy spirit" does not translate as سكينة sakinah used in a feminine term. the term sakinah means state of relaxation.

bahá'í faith

the bahá'í faith has the concept of the most great spirit'', seen as the bounty of god. it is usually used to describe the descent of the spirit of god upon the messengers/prophets of god, which are known as manifestations of god, and include among others jesus, muhammad and bahá'u'lláh. in bahá'í belief the holy spirit is the conduit through which the wisdom of god becomes directly associated with his messenger, and it has been described variously in different religions such as the burning bush to moses, the sacred fire to zoroaster, the dove to jesus, the angel gabriel to muhammad, and the maid of heaven to bahá'u'lláh. the bahá'í view rejects the idea that the holy spirit is a partner to god in the godhead, but rather is the pure essence of god's attributes.
