the hawker harrier was an experimental biplane torpedo bomber aircraft built by hawker aircraft to a specification issued in the 1920s  for the raf.

development

in 1925, the british air ministry laid down specifications for a replacement for the hawker horsley bomber and for a coastal torpedo bomber (specifications 23/25 and 24/25).  as these specifications were similar, the air ministry announced that a single competition would be held to study aircraft submitted for both specifications.  

sidney camm of hawker aircraft designed the harrier to meet the requirements of specification 23/25,  with the prototype (j8325) first flying in february 1927, the first of the competitors to the two specifications to fly.   the harrier was a two seater powered by a bristol jupiter viii armed with one vickers machine gun and one lewis gun carrying either one torpedo or a maximum of 1,000 lb (~500 kg) of bombs.

the prototype harrier was tested at the aeroplane and armament experimental establishment (a & aee) at martlesham heath  in november 1927, where, while it met the requirements of specification 23/25, and had satisfactory handling, it had an inferior bombload to the hawker horsley, the aircraft it was meant to replace .  it was therefore modified to carry a torpedo.  on testing the modified aircraft, however, it was found to be underpowered, being incapable of taking off with torpedo, gunner and a full fuel load.  it was therefore not considered further, the competition ultimately being won by the vickers vildebeest.

the prototype was used by bristol as an engine testbed, flying with the 870 hp bristol hydra and the 495 hp bristol orion engines .
