 stuart pimm plant extinction and the effect of climate change on plant biodiversity 

include: stuart pimm stated "the current rate of species extinction is about 100 times the natural rate".has plant life reached its limits? september 20, 2012 relating to effect of climate change on plant biodiversity.  209.26.222.162 (talk) 18:57, 15 october 2012 (utc)
thanks. it has been added in the section ongoing holocene extinction. rockmagnetist (talk) 18:10, 18 october 2012 (utc)

 human influence on extinction 

the article reads: 
"extinction of animals and plants caused by human actions may go as far back as the late pleistocene, over 12,000 years bp, but there is no direct evidence for this theory and it is more likely abrupt climate change played a much higher role in the extinction of larger mammals."

the source quoted is the text "are we now living in the anthropocene?". as far as i can see, the authors only state that humans didn't cause the climate changes thousands of years ago, they don't say that these climate changes caused the extinctions or that humans didn't cause them. most of the text is about the present and near future, but here's what they say about extinctons:

"biotic change
humans have caused extinctions of animal and plant species, possibly as early as the late pleistocene, with the disappearance of a large proportion of the terrestrial megafauna (barnosky et al., 2004). accelerated extinctions and biotic population declines on land have spread into the shallow seas, notably on coral reefs (bellwood et al., 2004) and the oceans (baum et al., 2003; myers and worm, 2003). the rate of biotic change may produce a major extinction event (wilson, 2002) analogous to those that took place at the k-t boundary and elsewhere in the stratigraphic column. the projected temperature rise will certainly cause changes in habitat beyond environmental tolerance for many taxa (thomas et al., 2004). the effects will be more severe than in past glacial-interglacial transitions because, with the anthropogenic fragmentation of natural ecosystems, “escape” routes are fewer. the combination of extinctions, global species migrations (cox, 2004), and the widespread replacement of natural vegetation with agricultural monocultures is producing a distinctive contemporary biostratigraphic signal."
i don't see support for the claim "it is more likely abrupt climate change played a much higher role in the extinction of larger mammals". ssscienccce (talk) 19:02, 27 january 2013 (utc)

the section, while describing events that are indeed dramatic, uses unnecessarily dramatic language. words like 'terrifying' and 'ruining' are not appropriate for an encyclopedic article, i.e. it's pov.1812ahill (talk) 14:38, 6 july 2013 (utc)

anthropomorphic change
the article states: "the ecosystems encountered by the first americans had not been exposed to human interaction and were far less resilient to man made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans, those environments seasoned as they were, having been exposed to over 10,000 years of human interaction." the scientific literature may not support this claim so it needs to have a reliable source.  — preceding unsigned comment added by 164.159.62.2 (talk) 18:41, 27 august 2013 (utc) 

the article says "north and south america[edit source | editbeta]
there was a debate as to the extent to which the disappearance of megafauna at the end of the last glacial period can be attributed to human activities, directly, by hunting, or indirectly, by decimation of prey populations. recent discoveries at monte verde in south america, and at meadowcroft rock shelter in pennsylvania have effectively ended the "clovis first" position of american archaeology and pushed the arrival of humans in the americas back many thousands of years. this coupled with a more complete fossil record of the extinct animals has weakened the correlation between human occupation and mega-fauna extinction in the americas. however around the world there is often a very strong correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction, an example being wrangel island in siberia, where the extinction of mammoths (approximately 2000 bc) coincided directly with the arrival of humans. furthermore, the success of mega-fauna in surviving previous more severe periods of climate change suggest natural events were not entirely to blame." 

this may be original research and so it requires support. please add this support.

 extinction rates "__x__ % of *all* species 

a small handful of microbiologists in my social circle cringe whenever they hear these sorts of statements, because - according to my friends - they almost never include microbial species, and in terms of sheer number they say microbial species are more than half the total. newsandeventsguy (talk) 00:42, 11 april 2013 (utc)

merge with quaternary extinction event
there are two articlles on the same topic. quaternary extinction event  — preceding unsigned comment added by 164.159.62.2 (talk) 19:47, 27 august 2013 (utc) 
actually, these are not the same event. the quaternary was earlier, before the beginning of human-created climate change, and may be related to the end of the last ice age.http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/geos462/05quatfaun.html 2601:640:4001:266c:b482:6bb5:ee4b:f86f (talk) 16:02, 19 june 2015 (utc)

confusions within the article
this is an incredibly confused and confusing article in need of a drastic rewrite.  it presents rival arguments claiming anthropogenic extinctions at different rates at different places.  it does not present the recent findings of the disappearance of large predators in africa over the last 2 million years, not the disappearance of megafauna in australia, or the north american findings of the association between clovis assemblage and us megafaunal disappearance.  it makes no reference to the richard leakey book "the sixth extinction" nor the work of tim flannery.  i suggest a complete re-write. 49.196.2.188 (talk) 06:40, 7 december 2013 (utc)

mccallum (2015) and mongabay as a source
regarding these diffs ,  i think that the paper is too primary and doesn't carry much weight as it's currently presented. it certainly does not justify removing apparently contradictory information that is sourced to cambridge university press and the new york times. mongabay.com is a blog owned by rhett butler, as mentioned here  which i don't believe meets reliable source standards at all because it's selfpub. hit counts have nothing to do with reliability. geogene (talk) 16:47, 16 july 2015 (utc)
