 stuart pimm plant extinction and the effect of climate change on plant biodiversity 

include: stuart pimm stated "the current rate of species extinction is about 100 times the natural rate".has plant life reached its limits? september 20, 2012 relating to effect of climate change on plant biodiversity.  209.26.222.162 (talk) 18:57, 15 october 2012 (utc)
thanks. it has been added in the section ongoing holocene extinction. rockmagnetist (talk) 18:10, 18 october 2012 (utc)

 human influence on extinction 

the article reads: 
"extinction of animals and plants caused by human actions may go as far back as the late pleistocene, over 12,000 years bp, but there is no direct evidence for this theory and it is more likely abrupt climate change played a much higher role in the extinction of larger mammals."

the source quoted is the text "are we now living in the anthropocene?". as far as i can see, the authors only state that humans didn't cause the climate changes thousands of years ago, they don't say that these climate changes caused the extinctions or that humans didn't cause them. most of the text is about the present and near future, but here's what they say about extinctons:

"biotic change
humans have caused extinctions of animal and plant species, possibly as early as the late pleistocene, with the disappearance of a large proportion of the terrestrial megafauna (barnosky et al., 2004). accelerated extinctions and biotic population declines on land have spread into the shallow seas, notably on coral reefs (bellwood et al., 2004) and the oceans (baum et al., 2003; myers and worm, 2003). the rate of biotic change may produce a major extinction event (wilson, 2002) analogous to those that took place at the k-t boundary and elsewhere in the stratigraphic column. the projected temperature rise will certainly cause changes in habitat beyond environmental tolerance for many taxa (thomas et al., 2004). the effects will be more severe than in past glacial-interglacial transitions because, with the anthropogenic fragmentation of natural ecosystems, “escape” routes are fewer. the combination of extinctions, global species migrations (cox, 2004), and the widespread replacement of natural vegetation with agricultural monocultures is producing a distinctive contemporary biostratigraphic signal."
i don't see support for the claim "it is more likely abrupt climate change played a much higher role in the extinction of larger mammals". ssscienccce (talk) 19:02, 27 january 2013 (utc)

the section, while describing events that are indeed dramatic, uses unnecessarily dramatic language. words like 'terrifying' and 'ruining' are not appropriate for an encyclopedic article, i.e. it's pov.1812ahill (talk) 14:38, 6 july 2013 (utc)

 extinction rates "__x__ % of *all* species 

a small handful of microbiologists in my social circle cringe whenever they hear these sorts of statements, because - according to my friends - they almost never include microbial species, and in terms of sheer number they say microbial species are more than half the total. newsandeventsguy (talk) 00:42, 11 april 2013 (utc)
