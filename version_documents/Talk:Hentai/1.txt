regarding the censorship, how do the japanese government censor the porn site on internet?  it is probably enforceable to ban hardcore web site based in japanese, but how is it possible to ban surfer to visit porn site based in the us?

juuitchan> i don't know. i think maybe it is not possible.

as with any other censorship, the prohibition ("thou shalt not") is independent of the enforcement method.  just because it's not technically feasible to effectively restrict information on the internet, doesn't make it less of a crime and doesn't reduce the penalty if you're found guilty of breaching the censorship.  censorship relies on people respecting government mandate (or fearing the penalties), not on technical blocks.  -- bignose

the bigger question is, why is this page in an encyclopedia, as opposed to a dictionary.

is hentai actually illegal in japan? is japanese-style hentai primarily for export, e.g., to the west? what are the restrictions on pornographic photos and drawings in japan?

how much of the talk of what is "permitted" in japanese sexuality is a reflection of what actually goes on in japan vs. the way they want to portray their society to outsiders?

i've seen japanese businessmen lined up 2 or 3 deep at magazine racks in nyc, looking at porno mags, some of which would be good for a quick trip to the federal pen (child pornography) if it were being viewed by americans in a regular english-language bookstore. what's up, is there a double standard? --uncle ed 14:44, 5 sep 2003 (utc)
