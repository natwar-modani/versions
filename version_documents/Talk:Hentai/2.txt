some idiot spamed the top of the page, can't see the actual typed part, its right at the top. can't figure out how the moron got it there...

gimme a break

hentai, is for all intents and purposes- first and foremost, art. it should be allowed to a certain extent (the pictures now are fine and not too overly graphic). i vote it stays. --pioffive 14:14, 9 april 2006 (utc)

no! too open wided
i say those other pictures should stay! although even if they are weak images and old pictures!

also i vote boku image should say!

it's already been agreed by most to not include the current picture (:image:fuusen q21.jpg). not sure if you're another sock puppet or not, but i find it odd your only contribution is that previous statement. -- ned scott 16:05, 9 april 2006 (utc)

you mean suker:p...sn00p d0g says suker duker:).
:image:fuusen q21.jpg is just dumb...i was raped and i fainted!?

:image:fuusen q21.jpg is a fine image. the psycho 02:25, 10 april 2006 (utc)
i know this probably isn't fair, but i'm really finding it hard to take any pro-fuusen q21.jpg argument seriously because they're all from users less than a month old. -- ned scott 03:38, 10 april 2006 (utc)

i do think that image:fuusen q21.jpg should be replaced with a more tasteful image, one that isn't take from jlist. it shouldn't be that hard to find an image that isn't as overt as image:fuusen q21.jpg. why use this tantalizing image when a a tamer image can illustrate the article just as well? --thefarix (talk) 23:15, 10 april 2006 (utc)

first of all, i really don't care much what the image for this article is. it's just not that important. if anyone types 'hentai' into google they'll find plenty. that aside, i feel that fuusen is a good image because it is representative of the vast majority of hentai without being extremely shocking. also, i have been a user for more than 1 month.

re: farix: "a more tasteful image"
i wouldn't call hentai itself "tasteful" by protestant-cultural standards. just thinking about all the hentai images i've seen in my life...can't really think of a tasteful one that doesn't have nudity. hentai denotes sex, not just nudes. otherwise it'd just be an ecchi picture, like the cover of a doujinshi, women in swimsuits or something (would that be "tasteful"?). however, women in swimsuits is not hentai. i feel that the image should be a real hentai image...readers of the article should get a full introduction to the subject, and not have to do research for themselves elsewhere or be misled by the article. otherwise, if people just feel porn is bad(and most people here seem to), then i'd say, better get rid of the image altogether than have a misleading one.

the trend on wikipedia seems to tend not to have images of explicit sex acts, or even half-nudes by themselves. if anyone here followed the debate at lolicon, the page was only unprotected after an image with no nipples/genitals/bare butts was chosen...in that case i'd say the "representativeness" of the image might have suffered, but hey, it's not locked anymore. :|

so i would argue for (1) fuusen, (2) no image, (3) an image without sex acts/fluids depicted.

in any case, we should unprotect the article. i feel that the article could be made clearer and more grammatically precise, and that has nothing to do with the picture. i'm interested in helping fix the article up. i don't feel that choosing an image is such a huge problem that the entire article has to be locked.

i vote for number 3!:p
>x<ino 20:50, 13 april 2006 (utc)

3, man. i agree that fluids are graphic. we could just use an image of a popular hentai girl w/o shirt (bra on) and a skirt on....--70.248.115.42 13:47, 14 april 2006 (utc)

sufficiently representative?
:image:awalcott.jpg is used on the playboy page. without being graphic it clearly demonstrates the erotic aspect of the magazine. why not try and find a similar image for use here? carterhawk

lol at that playboy cheap image:p
yea...we might need an image similar to that! because who da hell wants to look at fuusu image, seeing a woman being cummed all over. >:@
>x<ino 15:39, 12 april 2006 (utc)

"seeing a woman being cummed all over" is very, very, common in hentai.

i feel that fuusen, or a similar image, is a good compromise between representation and explicitness.

--zaorish 22:56, 12 april 2006 (utc)

yea...it may be common, but come on! that just looks nasty! that doesn't even look like the cum i have seen in certain hentai:p

by the way..you need to fix that thing blocking your babel, in your cheap profile:p
>x<ino 01:17, 13 april 2006 (utc)

i have found one that is not too overtly sexual, but it's rather small.

(click at own risk)--pioffive 13:51, 14 april 2006 (utc)

that's the kind of picture we need! but too small! >:@

ja interwiki
ja:18禁アニメ is the equivalent article in the japanese wiki. the linked article is about cartoon porn, for those unable to read japanese; would a kind admin please amend the article? and hadn't anyone noticed that an article named after a japanese term doesn't have an interwiki to jp? :) --sam pointon united fc 23:32, 10 april 2006 (utc)
very weird --haham hanuka 20:44, 13 april 2006 (utc)

alternate meaning

shouldn't there be a note near the top about hentai's alternate meaning of metemorphasis (as used in the gamecube game cubivore)? it's entirely possible that someone might come here trying to find information about that after playing cubivore or seeing/reading/etc. something else about the metamorphasis meaning.
--the_suicide_forest  03:04, 13 april 2006 (utc)
yes. i put it in earlier, but someone changed it. 変態 does not mean "strange appearance". those are the individual meanings of the kanji in the compound. the collective meaning of a compound is generally different from the individual meanings put together; in this case, it means "transformation" or "abberation", and is used in biology to mean "metamorphosis". note that on interwiki, ja:変態 links to metamorphosis_(biology).  --grenadier 19:17, 30 july 2006 (utc)

 pic 

can some admin add this picture to this article. i can't because page is locked. --haham hanuka 20:40, 13 april 2006 (utc) thumb|250px|right|hentai magazines being sold in japan

hmmm...that's a nice picture, we can explain how hentai is really into japan.
>x<ino 20:48, 13 april 2006 (utc)
the image seems acceptable at that size, as a thumbnail you can't really see anything too "shocking", but it is there in the image and gives the reader the option of clicking on it and seeing the full sized image.  i would also like to show support for this image being used in it's current form. -- ned scott 22:38, 13 april 2006 (utc)

ok, this is what i propose: hentai article via user:ned scott/sandbox -- ned scott 22:43, 13 april 2006 (utc)

ned you are overreacting! the picture doesn't have to be that big so the user can see it. the picture is just there to give an example. if its too small for the user, the user can click on the image. linking the user to another site, in wikipedia, but showing the picture in a larger image!
>x<ino 01:16, 14 april 2006 (utc)

i would propose that this image be used to replace the current one up. the thumbnail itself is much less offensive than the current one, however clicking on still gives an accurate if slightly less graphic representation of the genre. the current picture just seems too overly graphic. (more so than many mainstream hentai publications, at least except for a few panels usually located near the middle to end). i think this would allow us to show what hentai is without being overly perverted about it. the suicide forest 01:30, 14 april 2006 (utc)

can we just please add the picture of boku!. i hate fuusu, it's too nasty! and we can keep this picture. tash of p0rn/hentai:p

fair use issues

the uploader of creamlemonmakosexysymphonypart1manga.jpg did not specify where he got the image. androson 04:54, 16 april 2006 (utc)
it's a scan of the manga cover, that is the source.  sources are not always urls. -- ned scott 05:05, 16 april 2006 (utc)
image is unsourced.androson 05:08, 16 april 2006 (utc)
why are you even talking about this here? put a fair use disputed template on the image if you feel so strongly about it. -- ned scott 05:14, 16 april 2006 (utc)
image is sourced now. --日本穣 nihonjoe 01:10, 17 april 2006 (utc)

you people are starting to piss me off now! where is my boku picture >:@

 h-anime/hentai 

you know, the first few days and months i was at wiki. this article was called h-anime. what gives changing the name to hentai!?
now the h-anime article is for listing. >x<ino 02:08, 7 may 2006 (utc)

...i don't know how long you've been here, but according to the history this page was created under this title in 2001. there was a seperate h anime article which now redirects to list of h anime, but it never contained anything other than a short list of titles. shiroi hane 09:00, 7 may 2006 (utc)

so...there were 2 different articles before...no wonder, cuz before i used to call it hentai. after seeing that article, i later refere it to h-anime.
>x<ino 14:49, 7 may 2006 (utc)

yeah, h-anime is seperate due to the fact that you can split hentai into a ton of different sections. on wikipedia alone there is eroge (some people call them hentai games), h manga and then go further (when describing web comics etc). then you also have the different niches, such as bishojo, yaoi,yuri, shota, panchira,lolicon and futanari(spelling may be off), etc. the main hentai page is more of a landing page to describe and explain the concepts, then you have the seperate pages off of that which go more into detail about the different types that are made today and were made in the past.steve355 14:38, 6 december 2006 (utc)

 hentai and japanese tradition 

as non-japanese, i find it pretty hard to understand how a very socially-conservative population like japan's accept such severely explicit pornography, and even in public. the article doesn't tell much on how such thing is taken normally in japan. i think a sufficient explanation is needed.-- haisook 22:53, 12 june 2006 (utc)

uh, maybe they're not as "socially conservative" as you think?  some are, some aren't.  just like any other country.--68.227.68.36 03:49, 29 august 2006 (utc)

hentai really isn't accepted in public.  the only people who do flip through pornographic material in public are socially-ignorant otaku, not necessarily because it is socially acceptable, but because they are so tuned out of the real world.--69.141.190.230 06:13, 7 december 2006 (utc)
