regarding the censorship, how do the japanese government censor the porn site on internet?  it is probably enforceable to ban hardcore web site based in japanese, but how is it possible to ban surfer to visit porn site based in the us?

juuitchan> i don't know. i think maybe it is not possible.

as with any other censorship, the prohibition ("thou shalt not") is independent of the enforcement method.  just because it's not technically feasible to effectively restrict information on the internet, doesn't make it less of a crime and doesn't reduce the penalty if you're found guilty of breaching the censorship.  censorship relies on people respecting government mandate (or fearing the penalties), not on technical blocks.  -- bignose
