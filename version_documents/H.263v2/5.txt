h.263v2 (also known as h.263+ or as the 1998 version of h.263) is the informal name of the second edition of the itu-t h.263 international video coding standard. it retains the entire technical content of the original version of the standard, but enhances h.263 capabilities by adding several annexes which substantially improve encoding efficiency and provide other capabilities (such as enhanced robustness against data loss in the transmission channel).  the h.263+ project was completed in late 1997 or early 1998 (depending on what is considered completion), and was then followed by an "h.263++" project that added a few more enhancements in late 2000.  see the h.263 page for more details.
