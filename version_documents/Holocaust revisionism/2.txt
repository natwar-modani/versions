holocaust revisionism is the rejection of the conventional history of the holocaust in favor of some or all of the following claims: 
there was no specific order by adolf hitler or other top nazi officials to exterminate the jews, although their incarceration in concentration camps and use as slave labor in factories had that effect.
the nazis did not use gas chambers to mass murder jews.
the figure of six million jewish deaths is an irresponsible exaggeration.

holocaust revisionism is widely considered in the west to be an anti-semitic falsification and is not supported by any officially approved, tenured, or government funded historians.
