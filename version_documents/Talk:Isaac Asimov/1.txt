after writing the original foundation trilogy, asimov abandoned the story, and didn't come back until the 80's, where a considerable monetary offer from the publishing house was his main incentive (or at least so he tells in the preface to the book). in this and later books, asimov tries to bind together in a coherent whole a great deal of his fiction output, creating a future history of humanity.

... but creating rather sloppy and contrived joins between his older books, in the opinion of many readers. i think asimov's mysteries deserve some sort of a mention too. -- tarquin
