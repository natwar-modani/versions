which article should be the main one, and which the redirect? i prefer seppuku as the main article, with hara-kiri redirecting to it. ed poor

"hara-kiri" is what it is most widely known as in english, so that's where the article should be. --zundark, 2002 jan 11

there should be two entries, one for hara-kiri and one for seppuku. the former describes the usage of a word, the latter a form of honourable suicide. it is not as if both mean exactly the same (assuming the description is correct).--branko

the english dictionaries i've looked at just define "seppuku" as "hara-kiri". english usage is not the same as japanese. --zundark, 2002 jan 11

we don't list the unification church as the "moonies", just because it's the best known, right? if correctness or npov isn't an issue, then common usage should prevail, but i think npov and correctness should come first. --dmerrill

but the idea that "seppuku" is more correct than "hara-kiri" in english is itself non-npov. english dictionaries note that the word "moonies" is colloquial (and often derogatory), but they don't do so for "hara-kiri" (at least, not the ones i've looked at). --zundark, 2002 jan 11
