health sciences are the group of disciplines of applied science dealing with human and animal health.  there are two parts to health sciences: the study, research and development of the knowledge of health,  and the application of that knowledge to improve health, cure diseases, and understand how humans and animals function.  research builds primarily on the basic sciences of biology, chemistry, and physics as well as social sciences (for example medical sociology). other fields which have made an especially significant contribution to the health sciences include biochemistry, biotechnology, engineering, epidemiology, genetics, nursing, pharmacology, pharmacy, public health, and medicine. the health sciences industry, a multi-billion dollar business, is a subset of the life sciences, medical care, and diagnosis industries.
