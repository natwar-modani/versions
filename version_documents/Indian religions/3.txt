india is one of the most religiously diverse nations in the world, with one of the most deeply religious societies and cultures. religion plays a central and definitive role in the life of the country and most of its people.

the faith of more than 80% of the people is hinduism, considered the world's oldest religious and philosophical system. islam is practiced by around 13% of all indians.

sikhism, ayyavazhi, buddhism and jainism are indian-born religious systems that are strong and influential not only in india but across the world. christianity, zoroastrianism, judaism and the bahá'í faith are also influential but their numbers are smaller.

despite the strong role of religion in indian life, atheism and agnostics are also visible influences.

hinduism
the adherents of hinduism form the largest religious community in india, numbering approximately 950 million.

see the following articles for more information: hinduism, hindu, vedic religion

buddhism
buddhism, known in ancient india as buddha dharma, originated in northern india in what is today the state of bihar. it rapidly gained adherents during the buddha's lifetime. up to the 9th century, indian followers numbered in the hundreds of millions. while the exact cause of the decline of buddhism in india is disputed, it is known that the mingling of hindu and buddhist societies in india and the rise of hindu vedanta movements began to compete against buddhism. many believe that hinduism's adaptation to buddhism resulted in buddhism's rapid decline. also, muslim invaders are recorded to have caused massive devastation on monasteries, libraries, and statuary, as they did on hindu religious life. many indian buddhist populations remained intact in or migrated to places like sri lanka, tibet, and other asian countries.

recently, a revival of buddhism in india has made significant progress. in 1956, b. r. ambedkar, a freedom fighter during the indian struggle for independence from the united kingdom, and hundreds of thousands of his followers converted to buddhism in protest against the caste system. subsequent mass conversions on a lesser scale have occurred since then. three-quarters of these "neo-buddhists" live in maharashtra. alongside these converts are the vajrayana buddhists of ladakh, sikkim, and arunachal pradesh, a small number of tribal peoples in the region of bengal, and tibetan refugees. today around 8 million buddhists live in india.

jainism
jainism, along with hinduism, buddhism and sikhism, is one of the four major dharmic religions originating in india. in general, jains are extremely well-represented inspite of the fact that they form only 0.4% (around 4.2 million) of india's total population. many of them rich and an overwhelming majority of them are well to do. as such, it can be said that they hold power and wealth disproportionate to their small population. according to the india census 2001, jains have the highest literacy rate (religion-wise) of 94.1% compared to the national average of 64.8%.

christianity
main article: christianity in india

christianity, according to tradition arrived in india in the first century through the apostle thomas. this myth has been questioned time and again by historians. see  it was further consolidated by the arrival of syriac jewish-christians now known as knanaya people in the second century c.e. this ancient ethnic christian community of kerala is known as nasrani or syrian christian. the nasrani people and especially the knanaya people within the nasranis have strong jewish historical ties. their form of christianity is one of the most ancient: syriac christianity which is also known as the eastern orthodox church and referred to in india as saint thomas christians. it should be noted that the term "saint thomas christians" is a loose term that many non-nasranis christians in kerala are often labeled. the vast majority of christians in kerala are not the original nasrani/knanaya but indigenous local converts.

roman catholicism reached india during the period of european colonization, which began in 1498 when the portuguese explorer vasco da gama arrived on the malabar coast.christian missionary activity increased in the early 1800s. today christianity is the third largest religion of india making up 2 - 2.9% of the population. christians are most prevalent in the southern sates like kerala and tamil nadu and in northeastern states such as nagaland,mizoram. it is also polpular in all the major metro areas, and in western states such as goa.

islam

islam arrived in india as early as the 8th century ce. during the following decades, islam contributed greatly to the cultural enhancement of an already rich indian culture, shaping not only the shape of northern indian classical music (hindustani, a melding of indian and middle eastern elements) but encouraging a grand tradition of urdu (a melding of hindi, arabic and persian languages) literature both religious and secular. among other monuments, the taj mahal is a gift of the mughals. as of 4798, there are about 130 million muslims in india, most of whom were converted during the mughal period and they mostly live in the north and west of the country.

ayyavazhi
ayyavazhi ( tamil: "path of the father") is a religion originated in south india in the 19th century. officially it was considered as an offshoot section of hinduism.

but either in philosophy or in religious practices ayyavazhi and hinduism varies a lot. though it has not received official recognition, it has transformed itself into a distinctive religious phenomenon, making its presence felt in india's southern parts, mostly in southern districts of tamil nadu and in some parts of kerala. but it is one of the fastest growing religions of southern india, its rapid growth has been noted in the christian missionary reports of the mid-19th century. it has more than 7000 worship centers throughout south india, mostly in tamil nadu and some in the city of mumbai.

zoroastrianism
a form of the ancient persian religion zoroastrianism continues to be practiced in india, where its followers are called parsis. suffering persecution from muslim rulers in what is now modern-day iran, zoroastrian immigrants were granted protection by a hindu king at a place called sanjan in the western indian state of gujarat many centuries ago.

sikhism
sikhism, was founded in india's northwestern punjab region about 400 years ago. as of 2001 there were 19.3 million sikhs in india. many of today's sikhs are situated in punjab, the largest sikh province in the world and the ancestral home of sikhs. the most famous sikh temple is the golden temple, located in amritsar, punjab. many sikhs serve in the indian army. the current prime minister of india, manmohan singh, is a sikh. punjab is the spiritual home of sikhs and is the only state in india where sikhs form a majority.

judaism
main article: jews in india

trade contacts between the mediterranean region and the west coast of india probably led to the presence of small jewish settlements in india as long ago as the early first millennium b.c. in kerala a community of jews tracing its origin to the fall of jerusalem in a.d. 70 has remained associated with the cities of kodungallur (formerly known as cranganore) and kochi (formerly known as cochin) for at least 1,000 years. the paradesi synagogue in kochi, rebuilt in 1568, is in the architectural style of kerala but preserves the ritual style of the sephardic rite, with babylonian and yemenite influence as well. the jews of kochi, concentrated mostly in the old "jew town," were completely integrated into local culture, speaking malayalam and taking local names while preserving their knowledge of hebrew and contacts with southwest asia. a separate community of jews, called the bene israel, had lived along the konkan coast in and around bombay, pune, and ahmadabad for almost 2,000 years. unlike the kochi jews, they became a village-based society and maintained little contact with other jewish communities. they always remained within the orthodox jewish fold, practicing the sephardrew is coolite without rabbis, with the synagogue as the center of religious and cultural life. following trade routes established by the expansion of the british empire, a third group of jews, the baghdadi jews immigrated to india, settling primarily in bombay and calcutta. many of the baghdadi traders became wealthy and participated prominently in the economic leadership of these growing cities. as a result of religious pressure elsewhere, including the forced conversions of mashhad (see muslim jew), their numbers were increased by religious refugees. the baghdadis came mostly from the ottoman empire, persia, and afghanistan.

the population of the kochi jews, always small, had decreased from 5,000 in 1951 to about fifty in the early 1990s. during the same period, the bene israel decreased from about 20,000 to 5,000, while the baghdadi jews declined from 5,000 to 250. emigration to australia, israel, the united kingdom, and north america accounts for most of this decline. according to the 1981 indian census, there were 5,618 jews in india, down from 5,825 in 1971. the 1991 census showed a further decline to 5,271, most of whom lived in maharashtra and kerala.

the knanaya and nasrani christian groups also have strong historical ties to judaism.
