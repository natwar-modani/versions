hergé is the pseudonym of belgian comics' writer and artist georges remi. the pseudonym is a written representation of the sound you get when you pronounce the reversed initials, rg, in french. (could somebody rephrase this to sthg resembling english?)

born?

died? (1981?)

some of his comics include:

tintin

jo, zette et jocko

quick et flupke

tintin is his most important series, though. 

hergé influenced the european comic greatly. he was (one of?) the first european artists to use balloons (is that the right terminology in english) to represent speech in a panel (see previous question).
