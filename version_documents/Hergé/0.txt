hergé is the pseudonym of belgian comics writer and artist georges remi. the pseudonym is a written representation of the french pronunciation of "rg," the reverse of his initials. (how's this? well, his initials are "gr", or if you put surname first, "rg". i am guessing his language was french, since that is one of the two belgian languages and remi looks more french than dutch. the french name for the letter r is pronounced something like "air", and for g, something between "jay" and "shay". the french would prounounce "hergé" something like "airjay" or "airshay".)

(comment: hergé was frankophone, though apparently he did speak some dutch, because the artificial languages he used in his albums were mostly or all based on (a french phonetic?) representation of a dutch dialect called marollenvlaams, as spoken in brussels. --branko)

 born 1907
 died 1983

some of his comics include:

tintin
jo, zette et jocko
quick et flupke

tintin is his most important series. 

hergé influenced the european comic greatly. he was (one of?) the first european artists to use speech balloons to represent speech in a comic.
