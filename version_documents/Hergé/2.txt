hergé is the pseudonym of belgian comic strip writer and artist georges rémi (1907 - 1983). the pseudonym is a written representation of the french pronunciation of "rg", the reverse of his initials. 

some of his comics include:

 tintin
 jo, zette et jocko
 quick et flupke

tintin is his most important series. 

hergé influenced the european comic greatly. he was (one of?) the first european artists to use speech balloons to represent speech in a comic.

his style of drawing and narration is known as ligne claire, which remains an influence in franco-belgian comics to the present day.
