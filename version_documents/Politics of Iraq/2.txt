before the fall of saddam hussein in 2003, the ba'ath party officially ruled iraq through a nine-member rcc, which enacted legislation by decree. the rcc's president (chief of state and supreme commander of the armed forces) was elected by a two-thirds majority of the rcc. a council of ministers (cabinet), appointed by the rcc, had administrative and some legislative responsibilities. most western observers considered iraq a dictatorship under the personal rule of president hussein, whom they regarded as accountable to no one. the vice-president of iraq was taha yassin ramadan.

a 250-member national assembly consisting of 220 elected by popular vote who serve a four year term, and 30 appointed by the president to represent the three northern provinces, was last elected in march 2000. iraq is divided into 18 provinces, each headed by a governor with extensive administrative powers.

iraq's judicial system is based on the french model introduced during ottoman rule and has three types of lower courts--civil, religious, and special. special courts try broadly defined national security cases. an appellate court system and the court of cassation (court of last recourse) complete the judicial structure.
