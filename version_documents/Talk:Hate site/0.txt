complete re-write
i have completely deleted and re-written this article, and i hope i have reached npov. originally, i meant to create it as a /temp page, but it saved to the main article. i will re-add the cleanup tag, as my version still requires improvement.

should we be linking to hate sites? if someone is looking for examples he can more than easily find them by himself. -- wojpob

in my view, linking to sites on this page is actually pov itself. computerjo[[wp:ea|e]] 20:31, 19 february 2006 (utc)
i'm going to have to say i agree. while it is obvious the kkk is pro-hate, a member of the kkk might not think that.

we should link to them as an example to the reader, and we should state that they are examples --mexaguil 00:00, 4 march 2006 (utc)

this page is currently nothing more than a pov rant as to how to deal with hate sites. i've put it on pages needing attention.
