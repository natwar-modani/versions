a homeothermic (or "warm-blooded") animal is one that can keep its core body temperature at a constant level. this not only involves the ability to generate its own heat but also the ability to cool down if necessary.

diverse mechanisms can come into play to regulate body temperature, such as shivering (to generate heat from muscle contractions), blanching (circulatory changes designed to direct less heat to the skin), flushing (circulatory changes designed to radiate more heat from the skin), panting or sweating (to increase heat loss through evaporation).
