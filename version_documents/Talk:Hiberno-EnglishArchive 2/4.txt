it's a cupboard (or press in hiberno-english) over the water heater/boiler where the likes of bedclothes and towels are put after drying to "air" them. donnacha 22:08, 27 october 2006 (utc)

 what a mess 

this article is a hotch-potch of hunches, factoids, urban legend and folk-linguistic speculation, combined with lists of various favourite words and phrases, the whole misleadingly presented as reliable information. it reads like an article on plant physiology written by an accountant who fancies he has green fingers. it's in desperate need of attention, if not top-to-bottom rewriting, by a linguist (as opposed to an enthusiastic amateur) who has actually systematically studied hiberno-english on the basis of the wealth of scholarship that's been done over the last century and more. someone who won't, for example, confuse phonemes with letters, writing things like "'r' is pronounced wherever it occurs in the word".

 langerhead 

""langer" is a variant used especially in cork but has began to spread through the rest of the country."

langer originates with irish soldiers in the english army stationed in india. langar monkeys would wake them at all hours and throw crap at them so langar became a term of abuse. this was imported to cork on their return. check out http://langarland.com .

 langar monkey business 

if langar monkeys were a menace to the english army to the point where it became a term of abuse among them, then it's a bit baffling why the term survived only in cork. i'd like a source on this etymology. it sounds like one of those top-of-the-head folk etymologies based on the coincidence of two like-sounding words.
