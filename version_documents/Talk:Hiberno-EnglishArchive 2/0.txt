mitch with the same meaning is still used in the westcountry, even amongst my generation. sjc

i'm no linguist, so i dont know where the following should be added to this article. my parents are irish, and here are some expressions they use: 
the word yoke is sometimes used where the word thing might be used in standard english.
e.g. "what's that yoke for?"

the word mind is sometimes used for the word remember.
e.g. "i mind when i was a boy"
mintguy

i've never heard that usage. it is used for "take care/of" - "mind yourself crossing the street", though i'm not sure that's an exclusively irish usage. -- jim regan 16:20 22 jun 2003 (utc)

i can't figure out where to add to this article either, so here goes (should be familiar to british viewers of father ted):
 ye is used for the second person plural
 feck, means steal, or rather "take without permission", and is used as a euphemism for the word "fuck"
 lad is used as a euphemism for penis
 eejit is a mis-spelled, mis-pronounced version of idiot
 the "a" is father is generally pronounced fah ther or fah der rather than faw ther
 gobshite means fool
 many words also in use in britain, such as arse for ass, bollocks for testicles, shite for shit
