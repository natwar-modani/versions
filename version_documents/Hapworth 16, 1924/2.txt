"hapworth 16, 1924" is the "youngest" of j. d. salinger's glass family stories, in the sense that the narrated events happen chronologically before those in the rest of the glass series. it appeared in the june 19, 1965 edition of the new yorker, and has never been reprinted.

it is in the form of a letter from camp written by a seven-year-old seymour glass (the main character of "a perfect day for bananafish"). in the course of requesting a veritable library of reading matter from home, seymour condemns the ironic "twist" endings in the stories of anatole france; twist endings being an early salinger device.

after its appearance in the new yorker, salinger – who had already withdrawn to his house in new hampshire – stopped publishing altogether. since he never put the story between hard covers, readers had to seek out a copy of that issue or find it on microfilm. in 1996, orchises press, a small publishing house in virginia, announced that it would reprint "hapworth," and received substantial coverage in the press.lundegaard, karen m.
