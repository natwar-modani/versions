hapworth 16, 1924 is the "youngest" of j.d. salinger's glass family stories, in the sense that the narrated events happen chronologically before all other glass stories.   

it is in the form of letter from camp written by an (obviously precocious) seven-year-old seymour glass (the suicide of "a perfect day for bananafish").

unfortunately orchises press has now decided not to publish this work. it is an extremely rare find, though with searching it may be found in the june 19, 1965 edition of the new yorker. however, few of these new yorker editions exist for public consumption due to the rarity of the salinger story within.
