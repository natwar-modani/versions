hapworth 16, 1924 is the "youngest" of salinger's glass family stories, in the sense that the narrated events happen chronologically before all other glass stories.   it is in the form of letter from camp written by an (obviously precocious) seven-year-old seymour glass (the suicide of "perfect day for bananafish").
