henry laurens ( december 8, 1792) was an american merchant and rice planter from south carolina who became a political leader during the revolutionary war. a delegate to the second continental congress, laurens succeeded john hancock as president of the congress. he was a signatory to the articles of confederation.

laurens had earned part of his wealth by operating the largest slave-trading house in north america. in the 1750s alone, his charleston firm oversaw the sale of more than 8,000 enslaved africans.report of the brown university steering committee on slavery and justice he was for a time vice-president of south carolina and a diplomat to the netherlands during the revolutionary war. he was captured at sea and imprisoned for some time by the british in the tower of london.

his son john laurens persuaded the continental congress to allow slaves to enlist in exchange for freedom and was authorized to recruit a regiment (3000 men).  he believed that americans could not fight for their own freedom while slaves were held.  after john died during the war, the senior laurens later freed his slaves, as his son had urged.

laurens served in the militia, as did most able-bodied men in his time.  he rose to the rank of lt. colonel in the campaigns against the cherokee indians in 1757-1761. 

1757 also marked the first year he was elected to the colonial assembly. laurens was elected again every year but one until the revolution replaced the assembly with a state convention as an interim government.  the year he missed was 1773 when he visited england to arrange for his sons' educations.  he was named to the colony's council in 1764 and 1768, but declined both times.  in 1772 he joined the american philosophical society of philadelphia, and carried on extensive correspondence with other members.

as the american revolution neared, laurens was at first inclined to support reconciliation with the british crown. but as conditions deteriorated, he came to fully support the american position.  when carolina began to create a revolutionary government, laurens was elected to the provincial congress which first met on january 9, 1775.  he was president of the committee of safety, and presiding officer of that congress from june until march of 1776.  when south carolina installed a fully independent government, he served as the vice president of south carolina from march of 1776 to june 27, 1777.

henry laurens was first named a delegate to the continental congress on january 10, 1777.  he served in the congress from until 1780.  he was the president of the continental congress from november 1, 1777 to december 9, 1778.

in the fall of 1779 the congress named laurens their minister to the netherlands. in early 1780 he took up that post and successfully negotiated dutch support for the war.  but on his return voyage to amsterdam that fall, the british navy intercepted his ship, the continental packet mercury, off the banks of newfoundland. although his dispatches were tossed in the water, they were retrieved by the british, who discovered the draft of a possible u.s.-dutch treaty prepared by william lee.  this prompted britain to declare war on the netherlands, it becoming known as the fourth anglo-dutch war.

laurens was charged with treason, transported to england, and imprisoned in the tower of london (the only american to be held prisoner in the tower).  his imprisonment was protested by the americans.  in the field, most captives were regarded as prisoners of war, and while conditions were frequently appalling, prisoner exchanges and mail privileges were accepted practice. during his imprisonment, laurens was assisted by richard oswald, his former business partner and the principal owner of bunce island.  oswald argued on laurens' behalf to the british government. finally, on december 31, 1781 he was released in exchange for general lord cornwallis and completed his voyage to amsterdam. he helped raise funds for the american effort.

in a late skirmish during the war, laurens' oldest son john was killed in 1782. he had supported enlisting and freeing slaves for the war effort and intended to free his own.  after the war, henry laurens manumitted their slaves.paul finkelman, "thomas jefferson and antislavery: the myth goes on", the virginia magazine of history and biography, vol. 102, no. 2 (april 1994) p. 211, accessed 14 march 2011

in 1783 laurens was sent to paris as one of the peace commissioners for the negotiations leading to the treaty of paris.  while he was not a signatory of the primary treaty, he was instrumental in reaching the secondary accords that resolved issues related to the netherlands and spain.  richard oswald, a former partner of laurens in the slave trade, was the principal negotiator for the british during the paris peace talks. 

laurens generally retired from public life in 1784.  he was sought for a return to the continental congress, the constitutional convention in 1787 and the state assembly, but he declined all of these positions. he did serve in the state convention of 1788 where he voted to ratify the united states constitution.

later events
the british occupying forces from charleston had burned the main home at mepkin during the war. when laurens and his family returned in 1784, they lived in an outbuilding while the great house was rebuilt. he lived there the rest of his life, working to recover the estimated Â£40,000 that the revolution had cost him (equivalent to about $3,500,000 in 2000 values). 

after laurens died at his estate, mepkin, he was cremated and his ashes were interred there. afterward, the estate passed through several hands.  large portions of the estate still exist, and are used today as a trappist abbey.
