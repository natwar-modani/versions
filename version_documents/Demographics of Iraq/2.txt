 background 

iraq is the region known outside the islamic world as mesopotamia, the population estimate in 1920 was 3 million. the ruins of ur, babylon, and other ancient cities are situated in iraq, as is the legendary location of the garden of eden. almost 75% of iraq's population lives in the flat, alluvial plain stretching southeast from baghdad to basra and the persian gulf. the tigris river and  the euphrates river carry about 70 million cubic meters of silt annually from this plain down to the delta. the water from these two great rivers, and the fertility of the soil in the alluvial plain and the delta, allowed early agriculture to sustain a stable population as far back as the 6th millennium bc. 

over its long history, many civilizations grew and flourished in the region. following the dissolution of the ottoman empire, iraq was formed by the league of nations from three ottoman vilayets (regions), gaining independence in 1932.

the semitic iraqis today are an overall indigenous mesopotamian people, who are closely related to the indigenous ancient people, much like the case with the people of the levant. while modern-day iraqi arabs form part of the arab collective by virtue of their modern-day language and bonds to arab culture and history — they are in fact largely a blend of the various aramaic speaking groups indigenous to the region, as well as other groups like the persians, kurds and turkic peoples, and not the direct descendants of the tribes of arabia. however, during the arab expansion period, muslim arabs from arabia controlled the area and there was some amount of immigration.

shia islam is the predominant religion, followed by sunni islam and christianity. small communities of bahá'ís, mandaeans, and yezidis also exist. until 1948, there was also a 150,000 strong community of jews, but the community has dwindled down to no more than a handful today. most kurds are sunni muslim, with about 10% being shi'a faili kurds in central iraq.
