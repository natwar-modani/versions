thumb|200px|distribution of religious and ethnic groups in iraq

iraq was known in ancient times as mesopotamia. the ruins of ur, babylon, and other ancient cities are here, as is the legendary location of the garden of eden. almost 75% of iraq's population lives in the flat, alluvial plain stretching southeast from baghdad to basra and the persian gulf. the tigris river and  the euphrates river carry about 70 million cubic meters of silt annually from this plain down to the delta. the water from these two great rivers, and the fertility of the soil in the alluvial plain and the delta, allowed early agriculture to sustain a stable population as far back as the 4th millennium bc. 

over its long history, many civilizations grew and flourished in the region. following the dissolution of the ottoman empire, iraq was formed by the league of nations from three ottoman vilayets (regions), gaining independence in 1932. 

iraq's two largest ethnic groups are arabs and kurds. other distinct groups are turkomans, assyrians, iranians, lurs, and armenians. arabic is the most commonly spoken language. kurdish is spoken in the north, and english is the most commonly spoken western language.

most iraqi muslims are members of the shiites (shi'a), but there is a large sunni muslim population as well, made up of both arabs and kurds. small communities of christians, jews, bahá'ís, mandaeans, and yezidis also exist, although most jews have fled iraq over the last century. most kurds are sunni muslim but differ from their arab neighbors in language, dress, and customs.
