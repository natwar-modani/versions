hannibal hamlin (august 27, 1809 â€“ july 4, 1891) was the 15th vice president of the united states, serving under president abraham lincoln from 1861-1865.  he was the first vice president from the republican party.

prior to his election in 1860, hamlin served in the united states senate, the house of representatives, and, briefly, as governor of maine.

early life
hamlin was born on paris hill (national historic district) in paris, maine, in oxford county, a descendant of james hamlin in the sixth generation who had settled in the massachusetts bay colony in 1639 and a great nephew of senator samuel livermore ii of new hampshire. he attended the district schools and hebron academy there, and later managed his father's farm. for the next few years he worked at several jobs: schoolmaster, cook, woodcutter, surveyor, manager of a weekly newspaper in paris, and a compositor at a printer's office. he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1833. he began practicing in hampden, a suburb of bangor, where he lived until 1848.

 political beginnings
hamlin's political career began in 1836, when he began a term in the maine house of representatives after being elected the year before. he served in the aroostook war, which took place in 1839. hamlin unsuccessfully ran for the united states house of representatives in 1840 and left the state house in 1841. he later served two terms in the united states house of representatives, from 1843-1847. he was elected to fill a senate vacancy in 1848 and to a full term in 1851. a democrat at the beginning of his career, hamlin supported the candidacy of franklin pierce in 1852.

from the very beginning of his service in congress he was prominent as an opponent of the extension of slavery; he was a conspicuous supporter of the wilmot proviso, and spoke against the compromise measures of 1850.  in 1854 he strongly opposed the passage of the kansas-nebraska act, which repealed the missouri compromise.  after the democratic party endorsed that repeal at the cincinnati convention two years later, on june 12, 1856 he withdrew from the democratic party and joined the newly organized republican party, causing a national sensation. 

the republicans nominated him for governor of maine in the same year, and having carried the election by a large majority he was inaugurated in this office on the january 8, 1857. in the latter part of february, however, he resigned the governorship, and was again a member of the senate from 1857 to january 1861.

vice presidency
in 1860, he actually won presidency, but he gave the ticket to the republican canidate, abraham lincoln and became vice president.  while vice president he was not necessarily one of the chief advisers to president abraham lincoln, although he urged both the emancipation proclamation and the arming of african americans.  he strongly supported joseph hooker's appointment as commander of the army of the potomac, which was a dismal failure.  it is believed that this was among the decisions that along with his identification with the radical republicans caused him to be dropped from the ticket in 1864.  lincoln left no record of why he was switching his vice-president.  he chose andrew johnson, who was a member of the democratic party and a southerner.
