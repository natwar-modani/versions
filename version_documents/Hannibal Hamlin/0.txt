hamlin was born in the paris hill district of south paris, maine, in oxford county. he attended the district schools and hebron academy there, and later managed his father's farm. for the next few years he worked at several jobs: schoolmaster, cook, woodcutter, surveyor, manager of a weekly newspaper in paris, and a compositor at a printer's office. he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1833. he began practicing in hampden, where he lived until 1848.

from the very beginning of his service in congress he was prominent as an opponent of the extension of slavery; he was a conspicuous supporter of the wilmot proviso, and spoke against the compromise measures of 1850.  in 1854 he strongly opposed the passage of the kansas-nebraska bill, which repealed the missouri compromise.  after the democratic party endorsed that repeal at the cincinnati convention two years later, on june 12, 1856 he withdrew from the democratic party and joined the newly organized republican party, causing a national sensation.
