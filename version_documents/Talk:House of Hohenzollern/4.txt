aren't the rulers of liechtenstein still hohenzollerns? --corvus13

i don't you .check http://www.webtop.com , i have to leave. h. jonat

i do "you" -- the family name of the rulers of liechtenstein is "liechtenstein". they've been around for ages -- since the 12th century, i think -- mostly because of their impressive ability to look completely inoffensive when necessary. kind of like a hedgehog. -- paul drye

i'm back. glad that someone knows. all i know about liechtenstein ist that they have the silesian black eagle (with the white stripe through the wings) in their crest.
