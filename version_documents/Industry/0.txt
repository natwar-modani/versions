an industry is generally any grouping of businesses that share a common method of generating profits, such as the "music industry", the "automobile industry", or the "cattle industry".  usually an industry is also used specifically to refer to an area of economic production focused on manufacturing which involves large amounts of capital investment before any profit can be realized, also called "heavy industry.".  as of 2004, financial services is the largest industry (or category of industries) in the world in terms of earnings. 

industry in the second sense became a key sector of production in european and north american countries during the industrial revolution, which upset previous mercantile and feudal economies through many successive rapid advances in technology, such as the development of steam engines, power looms, and advances in large scale steel and coal production. industrial countries then assumed a capitalist economic policy. railroads and steam-powered ships began speedily integrating previously impossibly-distant world markets, enabling private companies to develop to then-unheard of size and wealth. manufacturing is a wealth producing sector in an economy.  following the industrial revolution, perhaps a third of the world's economic output is derived from manufacturing industriesâ€”more than agriculture's share. 

in economics and urban planning, industrial is a type of land use and economic activity involved with manufacturing and production.

history
cottage industry

guilds

a development of pre-industrialized societies, guilds were associations of artisans within the same trade. guilds provided mutual support for the member's interests, and maintained standards of workmanship and ethical conduct. in europe during the middle ages, guilds provided a powerful influence on the political systems within towns and cities. new guild members were required to atudy under a master of the craft as an apprentice, then spent a period of time as a journeyman before becoming a master craftsman. 

medieval guilds held a monopoly of trade within the town in which they operated. during the eighteenth century, however, guilds came under increasing criticism for hindering free trade and technological development and transfer. however the guild system still continues to operate in some parts of the economy to this day.
