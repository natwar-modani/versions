the irish people are mainly of celtic origin, with the country's only significant sized minority having descended from the anglo-normans. english is the common language, but irish (gaelic) also is an official language and is taught in the schools.

a national literature in irish is reemerging. anglo-irish writers, including swift, sheridan, goldsmith, burke, oscar wilde, james joyce, william butler yeats, george bernard shaw, and samuel beckett, have made a major contribution to world literature over the past 300 years.
