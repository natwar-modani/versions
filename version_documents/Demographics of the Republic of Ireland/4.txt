the irish people are mainly of gaelic ancestry, and although some of the population is also of english, scottish (also often gaelic), anglo-norman, viking, welsh and iberian ancestry, these groups have been assimilated and do not form distinct minority groups. celtic culture and language forms an important part of national identity. the irish travellers are an ethnic minority group.

for centuries a nation of emigrants, ireland from the 1990s has attracted immigrants from a number of nations both within europe and elsewhere.

language

the official languages are irish and english. however, english is the predominant language used today. people living in irish-speaking communities are limited to the low hundreds of thousands in isolated pockets largely on the western seaboard and in dublin and other urban areas. all schoolchildren are taught the irish language as a compulsory part of the school curriculum with a relatively small (though growing) number of schools teaching all subjects in irish. public signs are usually bilingual and there are both a national irish language tv (tg4) and radio channel (raidi√≥ na gaeltachta). the shelta language is spoken by anywhere between 6000 and 25000 people-predominantly members of the travelling ("gypsy") community-but has no official status.

religion

the republic of ireland is officially 88.4% roman catholic. however there has been a massive decline in adherence to roman catholicism among irish catholics. between 1996 and 2001, regular mass attendance, already previously in decline, declined from 60% to 48%. (it had been 90%+ in 1973.) 

all but two of its priest-training seminaries have either closed or are expected to close soon. the roman catholic church was hit in the 1990s by a series of sexual scandals, including the resignation of one bishop who had fathered a child by a divorced cousin and the notorious case of child sexual abuser fr. brendan smyth. in recent years, another bishop has been forced to resign over his incompetent handling of paedophile priests in his diocese.  

the second largest religion, the church of ireland (anglican), with a largely elderly membership, had until recently been in decline. it had been forced to close down many of its rural churches, and even some in urban areas. however, recent immigration of thousands of african anglicans has buoyed the church's following. a similar phenomenon is also affecting the very small jewish community in ireland, which is ageing and sees many of its younger adherents emigrating to israel. the religions showing major growth are islam (see islam in ireland) and small born-again christian faiths associated with ireland's growing immigrant communities. 

the country also has a small jewish community with 1,790 members, according to the census of 2002.
