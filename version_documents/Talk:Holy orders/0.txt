what about holy orders in eastern orthodoxy? or holy orders in anglicanism?

this is wikipedia.  put in a subhead and start typing.  i started with what i know best, and people added things. (notice that the entry makes no claims to completeness even for catholicism - it says 'in modern catholicism'.  i hope we'll get the history eventually). --michaeltinkler
