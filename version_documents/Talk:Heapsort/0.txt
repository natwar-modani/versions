i think there's a bug in the final line of the 
python program. should it not be 
called with the first element of the array, 1
instead of with 0?

is it for some reason impractical to implement a quaternary heapsort? --anonymous idiot, 2002 december 17, 10:13 pm

to my mind o(n log n) is not approximately linear for large n,
but i suppose it depends on your viewpoint. there are sort methods which are linear - e.g pigeon hole sort for a densely populated set of integers, and these
could be expected to run significantly faster.

however, both heapsort and quicksort are, for most practical purposes, amongst the
fastest sorts. note that scrambling the elements before doing a quicksort is often
more effective - as often the elements are almost in order, in which case quicksort is known to be slow. this does not apply to heapsort.
