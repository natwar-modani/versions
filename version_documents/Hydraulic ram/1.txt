a hydraulic ram is a water-powered cyclic pump. it harnesses the "water hammer" effect to pump a portion of the water being used to power the pump to a higher point than where the water originally started.  it is sometimes used in remote areas where the right conditions exist, since it requires no outside source of power other than the energy of falling water.

in operation, falling water runs downhill until it builds up enough force to close the discharge valve.  this valve closes suddenly causing a pressure surge, known as water hammer, which then compresses gas (often air) inside a pressure vessel.  a check valve closes, and the compressed gas pushes the water uphill past another open check valve.  once gas in the pressure chamber has expanded and moved the water as far uphill as it can, this check valves closes.  the gas in the pressure vessel is now at a lower pressure than the falling water.  the discharge valve once more opens and the cycle repeats itself.
