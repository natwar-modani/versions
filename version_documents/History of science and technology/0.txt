eo:historio de scienco kaj teknologio
the history of science and technology (hst) is a field of history which examines how humankind's understanding of the natural world has changed over the millennia, and how this understanding has allowed us to generate technologies which have modified that world.
discoveries such as those of natural selection, the structure of genes and dna, and within psychology have radically altered how we humans see ourselves, often  conflicting with religious views.
new technologies let us visit other planets, travel faster than sound, and kill each other with greater efficiency. 

hst aims to understand how science and technology progress and how we form theories by studying the lessons of the past, while also exploring the socio-political and cultural mileau within which scientists and technologists work.
