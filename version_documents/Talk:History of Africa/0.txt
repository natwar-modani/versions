this is the history of africa, geographical classification.

well, an article called "history of africa" should be an article about the history of africa.  it shouldn't be a link page, i think; we certainly should have an article about the history of africa on this page.  it probably shouldn't be on an "outline of the history of africa" page, because one goes to a "history of africa" page precisely to get an outline of the history of africa.

to link to a topic that doesn't have an obvious focus within one of the regions below, create a link here at the top level and/or link it within multiple region pages.

in a certain way, there is really no such thing as a "top-level" page within wikipedia.  pages can and should be linked to from a wide variety of other relevant pages.

anyway, this sort of thing goes without saying on wikipedia.  we want to interlink pages as much as possible--more or less.

an article about "history of africa" could be a) very big b) an outline c) a link page.

a) is not good i think, since you can't easy link into a big page.
you suggest b) which is ok.

but i think the regions should be left as a separate page and linked at the beginning of the
article.
