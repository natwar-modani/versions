the horned god is a modern syncretic term used amongst wiccan-influenced neopagans, which unites numerous male nature gods out of such widely-dispersed and historically unconnected mythologies as the celtic cernunnos,  the english herne the hunter, the hindu pashupati and the greek pan.

a number of figures from british folklore, though normally depicted without horns, are nonetheless considered related: puck, robin goodfellow and the green man.

development of an idea
[[image:baphomet.png|thumb|right|eliphas levi's illustration of baphomet, in his dogme et rituel de la haute magie, 1855, accompanied the first suggestion of an ancient horned god driven underground by the spread of christianity.]] 

the idea that all such horned images were of deities and that they represented manifestations of a single horned god, and that christianity had attempted to suppress his worship by associating him with satan, developed in the fashionable 19th-century occultist circles of england and france. eliphas levi's famous illustration (right) of baphomet, in his dogme et rituel de la haute magie (1855) (based on based on goya's witches sabbath painting (1789)) accompanied the first suggestions to this effect. levi's image of "baphomet" is reflected in most depictions of the devil made since. symbolism is drawn from the diable card of the 17th and 18th century tarot of marseille: the bat-winged, horned and hoofed figure with female breasts, perched upon a globe; levi added the caduceus of mercury at his groin, moved the flaming torch to crown his head and had him gesture towards lunar crescents above and below.

this was not an evil figure, levi contended, but a god of the old world, driven underground and condemned as a figure of witchcraft by hostile christianity. figures such as aleister crowley and margaret murray took up this suggestion and blended it with an adaptation of cultural anthropologies such as that of james frazer to define a pan-european fertility god. where frazer saw modern folklore and folk customs as the echoes of forgotten agricultural rituals, authors such as murray and her contemporaries at the folklore society saw it as evidence of the survival of an esoteric fertility cult, a secret tradition driven underground and suppressed by christianity. margaret murray suggested that christian reports, often aquired by victims under torture, of witches meeting in the woods with satan were actually pagans with their priest wearing a horned helmet to invoke their horned god murray, margaret, witch-cult in western europe 1921. these themes shaped both the modern concept of the horned god revered by some neopagan groups (such as wicca) today, and the popular image of the devil although murray's theories were later discredited.

sacred horned or antlered animals that signalled the numinous presence of a deity were ubiquitous in the ancient world, and certain scholars have criticised worshippers who blur "the very important distinctions between a god named, described, represented, and worshipped in animal form, a real animal worshipped as a god, animal symbols and animal masks in the cult, and finally the consecrated animal destined for sacrifice." (burkert 1985 p 64). many sacred bulls and goats, sacred stags and ibexes serve as examples. not all horned gods and their priests were male; astarte and isis (borrowing an attribute from hathor), for example, were sometimes depicted with horns. 

associations
margaret murray and later neopagans have associated the horned god with woods, wild animals, and hunting. he is often also associated with sexuality or male virility. cernunnos is associated with sailors (his most famous image is on the pillar of the boatmen) and commerce (several images include cornucopiae, overflowing with coins rather than food). as a symbol of sexuality, the horned god represents one of the most elemental forces in nature, and is often placed alongside female fertility deities.

the horned god has also been proposed by murray as the archetypal "hunter", a deity who not only gives life, but takes it too, in what is seen as a great and eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.

the horned god is always portrayed with horns or antlers, which are his distinguishing feature. horns have been revered religious symbols in a number of ancient cultures. an altar made entirely of stag horns was built in the temple of apollo at delos, and temples to the goddess diana usually contained horns as well. the horn is also seen as a symbol of fruitfulness and bounty, as in the horn of plenty.

some have associated merlin with the horned god, perhaps due to an older origin before the two developed their eventual and individual identities. he was often seen in the company of stags, and himself was sometimes described with stag-like attributes. furthermore, in at least one account he interrupted a wedding by riding into the assemblage atop a great stag, drunk and very belligerent.geoffrey of monmouth, vita merlini

satan
the depiction of satan as a horned and hoofed goat-like monster holding a trident is a 19th century invention, probably becoming popular as a response of christian morality to the growing popularity of the greek god pan in the art and literature of the time. previous depictions of the devil were much more varied, and he was often simply a man dressed in black, or a dog or goat. when depicted as a composite animal/human figure, the devil often had bat's wings, the talons of a bird of prey, and so on.

the horned god does not share satan's attributes either: while the christian satan is described as a fallen angel and is essentially evil, the neopagan horned god is believed to be a force of nature, neither entirely benevolent nor entirely malevolent: in his role as father, he is said to give life, but in his role as hunter, he is also said to take life. positive aspects of the horned god have more recently been re-attributed to satan by the church of satan and similar branches of modern satanism.

wicca
in the religion of wicca, first publicised in 1954, the horned god is revered as the partner and/or child of the goddess (commonly described as the great mother or the triple goddess). according to gerald gardner wicca is a modern survival of an ancient pan-european pagan religion that was driven underground during the witch trials. as such the goddess and horned god (the "lady" and "lord") of wicca are the supposed ancient tribal gods of this faith.gardner, gerald witchcraft today. however, there is little evidence to support claims that the religion originates earlier than the mid-20th century, and gardner himself states that he had reconstructed the rites from fragments, incorporating elements from english folklore such as murray (see above) and contemporary influences such as the golden dawn.

in modern wicca, "the horned god" may refer individually to any of a multitude of localized gods of different cultures (such as cernunnos or pan), or to the universal archetype many wiccans believe such gods represent. in the latter context, he is sometimes referred to as the "great god" or the "great father", who impregnates the goddess and then dies during the autumn and winter months and is reborn in springjanet and stewart farrar, the witches' bible..
