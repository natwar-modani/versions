historical-comparative linguistics is primarily the study of languages which
are recognizably related through similarities such as vocabulary, word formation, 
and syntax.  comparison allows for a unique perspective of how the individual 
languages developed, through external change or otherwise.  

studies have been focused mostly in the area of indo-european languages.  

historical-comparative linguistics aims to classify the world's languages by their genetic affiliations and to trace the historic development of languages.
