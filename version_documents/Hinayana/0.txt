the hinayana. (sanskrit lit. lesser vehicle) denotes a collection of ancient indian schools of buddhism that are now mostly extinct. the theravadin school being the sole surviving representative.

hinayana is now widely thought of as pejorative - the word hina means "inferior, low; poor, miserable; vile, base, abject, contemptible, despicable" (from the pali text society dictionary). the term was coined by the mahayana schools as a way to differentiate themselves from the early schools. mahayana texts frequently contain polemics against formalism and disputed doctrines which are directed at monks from the schools which subsequently became known as hinayana.

however term is still in current use to describe the early buddhist schools, especially in tibetan buddhist circle because they uniquely inherited texts and teachings from all of the "yanas". there doesn't seem to be a widely accpeted, or understood, alternative. early buddhism is frequently used, but is not entirely accurate because some of the 'early' schools arose later than the mahayana schools. the use of theravada is not correct either as the theravada are not reprensentative of the other early schools, despite having roots that go back to that time.

some remnants of these schools do still exist. the geluk school of tibetan buddhism still use a sarvastivada vinaya, and chinese schools use one from the dharmagupta school. fragments of the canon of texts from these schools also survive, often in tibetan or chinese translation. only the theravadin pali canon survived intact.
